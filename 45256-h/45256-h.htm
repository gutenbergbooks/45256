<h2><a id="PREFACE_TO_VOL_II"></a>PREFACE TO VOL. II</h2>

<p>Following is a synopsis of the documents contained
in the present volume:</p>

<p>IX. The indefatigable Biard presents, herein, a
graphic recital of his work among the Acadian savages,
and particularly his journeys into the wilderness.
His report of a trip with a party of Port Royalists to
French trading posts on the St. Croix and St. John
rivers, to an Etchemin town probably on the site of
the present Castine, Me., and to an English fishing
station on the Kennebec, is full of interest.</p>

<p>X. Herein, Biard sends to the general of his order
a full report concerning: (1) New France, its
physical characteristics, and its aborigines; (2) the
circumstances attending the opening of the Jesuit
mission in Acadia; (3) Fléché's work previous to
the coming of the Jesuits; (4) visits to savage tribes
by Massé and himself, with descriptions of conversions
and baptisms, and a statement of the conditions
and prospects of spiritual work among the aborigines.</p>

<p>XI. Lescarbot's <em>Relation Dernière</em> gives an account
of Poutrincourt's voyage to New France, in 1610; of
the conversion and baptism of the savage chief, Membertou,
and others, by the priest, Fléché; of Biencourt's
return to France; and of the experiences of
Poutrincourt at Port Royal. The writer praises Poutrincourt
for his exertions in Canada in behalf of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
both religion and civilization; and urges that he
should be aided in his colonial enterprise, as a necessary
basis for religious work in this portion of the
New World. He gives a list of the sponsors of the
baptized Indians, who included many of the French
nobility and clergy. The life at Port Royal is pictured
in some detail; its labors and privations are
dwelt upon; and the customs of the natives described.
Lescarbot does not fail, although cautiously, to exhibit
his dislike of the Jesuits, and endeavors to show
that their coming to Port Royal involved delay and
expense to the colonial enterprise, thereby injuring
Poutrincourt. Our author's closing chapter devoutly
catalogues the "Effects of God's Grace in New
France;" he describes how Providence cared for the
colonists in their distress, saved them from shipwreck,
kindly disposed the savages toward them and the
Christian religion, and returned to the Frenchmen
their ship, in time to prevent starvation. The rescue
of Aubry is also mentioned.</p>

<p>XII. The <em>Relatio Rerum Gestarum (1613 &amp; 1614)</em>
opens with a description of New France, its geography,
its climate, its peoples and their customs. The
experience of the Jesuit fathers at Port Royal is related
at length, from their own point of view. A description
is given of the settlement of St. Sauveur,
on Mount Desert Island, and its destruction by the
Virginian, Argall. Then follows an account of the
life of the Jesuit prisoners, in Virginia and England.
The conclusion is reached that, despite these drawbacks,
the Jesuit mission in Canada has made a hopeful
beginning.</p>

<p>S'il nous failloit entrer en compte devant
Dieu et Vostre Reverence du geré et negocié par
nous en ceste nouvelle acquisition du Fils de Dieu,
ceste nouvelle France et Chrestienté, depuis nostre
arrivée jusques à ce commencement de nouvel an, je
ne doubte point certes, qu'en la sommation et calcul
final, la perte ne surmontast les profits; le despensé
follement en offençant, le bien et sagement ménagé
en obeyssant, et le receu des talents, graces et tolerances
divines, le mis et employé au royal et amiable
service de nostre grand et autant bening Createur.
Neantmoins, d'autant que (comme je croy) nos ruines
n'édifiroyent personne, et nos rentes n'establiroyent
aucun, il vaudroit mieux que pour le malacquitté,
nous le plorions à part; [45] pour le receu, nous imitions
le metayer d'iniquité loué par Nostre Seigneur
en l'Evangile, sçavoir est que, faisant part à autruy
des biens de nostre Maistre, nous nous en faisions
des amis, et que communiquant à plusieurs ce qui est
d'édification en ces premiers fondemens de Chrestienté,
nous obtenions plusieurs intercesseurs envers
Dieu, et fauteurs de cet &oelig;uvre. Mesme que ce
faisant, nous ne defrauderons en rien la debte, ainsy
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
que fit le Censier inique, baillant à plusieurs le bien

<h3>[44] Letter from Father Pierre Biard to the Reverend
Father Provincial, at Paris.</h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Copied from the autograph preserved in the archives of
Jesus, at Rome.</em>)</p>

The peace of Christ be with you.
</p>

<p>Were we compelled to give an account before
God and Your Reverence of our administration and
our transactions in this newly acquired kingdom of
the Son of God, this new France and new Christendom,
from the time of our arrival up to the beginning
of this new year, I certainly do not doubt that, in the
aggregate and final summing up, the loss would exceed
the profits; the foolish cost of transgression,
the goodness and wisdom of obedience; and the
reception of divine talents, graces, and indulgence
would exceed their outlay and use in the royal and
agreeable service of our great and so benign Creator.
Nevertheless, inasmuch as (I believe) no one would
be edified by our losses, or greatly benefited by our
gains, it is better that we mourn our losses apart;
[45] as to our receipts, we shall be like the unjust
steward commended by Our Lord in the Gospels,
namely, by sharing our Master's goods with others
we shall make them our friends; and in communicating
to many what is edifying in these early foundations
of Christianity, we shall obtain intercessors with
God and supporters of this work. Yet in doing this
we shall in no wise diminish the debt, as did the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
wicked Steward, giving out Our Master's goods with
profit; but we shall, perhaps, by this prudence acquit
ourselves of a part of the dues and interests.
So be it.</p>

eight<a name="endanchor_1._1" id="endanchor_1._1"></a><a href="#endnote_1._1" class="endanchor">1</a> months have
passed since our arrival in this new France. Soon
after that, I wrote you in regard to the condition in
which we found this infant Church and Colony. Here
is what followed:</p>
</div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">

<p>Monsieur de Potrincourt s'en allant en France le
mois de Iuin dernier, laissa icy son fils Monsieur de
Biencourt, ieune seigneur de grande vertu et fort
recommandable, avec environ 18 siens domestiques,
et nous deux prestres de la Compagnie. Or la tasche
et travail de nous deux prestres, selon nostre vocation,
a esté, et icy dans la maison et habitation en residant,
et dehors en voyageant. Commençons, comme
l'on dict, de chez nous, de [46] la maison et habitation;
puis nous sortirons dehors.</p>
</div>
<div class="translation">

<p>When Monsieur de Potrincourt went to France
last June he left his son here, Monsieur de Biencourt,
a young man of great integrity and of very estimable
qualities, with about eighteen of his servants and us
two priests of the Society. Now our duties and offices,
in accordance with our calling as priests, have
been performed while residing here at the house and
settlement, and by making journeys abroad. Let us
begin, as they say, at home, that is, at [46] the residence
and settlement; then we shall go outside.</p>

</div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">

<p>Icy donc nos exercices sont: dire messe tous les
jours, la chanter solemnellement les dimanches et
festes, avec les Vespres, et souvent la procession;
faire prieres publiques matin et soir; exhorter, consoler,
donner les sacremens, ensevelir les morts;
enfin faire les offices de Curé, puisque autres prestres
n'y a en ces quartiers que nous. Et de vray, bon
besoing seroit que fussions meilleurs ouvriers de
Nostre Seigneur; d'autant que gens de marine, tels
que sont quasi nos paroissiens, sont assez d'ordinaire
totalement insensibles au sentiment de leur ame,
n'ayans marque de religion sinon leurs juremens et
reniemens, ny cognoissance de Dieu sinon autant
qu'en apporte la pratique connue de France, offusquée
du libertinage et des objections et bouffonneries
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
mesdisantes des heretiques. D'où l'on peut aussy
veoir, quelle esperance il y a de planter une belle
chrestienté par tels evangelistes. La première chose
que ces pauvres Sauvages apprennent, ce sont les
juremens, parolles sales et injures; et orriés souvent
les Sauvagesses (lesquelles autrement sont fort craintives
et pudiques), mais vous les orriés souvent charger
nos gens de grosses pourries et eshontées opprobres,
en langage françois; non qu'elles en sachent
la signification, ains seulement parce qu'elles voyent
qu'en telles parolles est leur [47] commun rire et ordinaire
passetemps. Et quel moyen de remedier à
cecy en des hommes qui mesprennent (malparlent)
avec (d'autant) plus d'abandon qu'ils mesprisent avec
audace.</p>
</div>
<div class="translation">

<p>Here then are our occupations: to say mass every
day, and to solemnly sing it sundays and holidays,
together with Vespers, and frequently the procession;
to offer public prayers morning and evening;
to exhort, console, administer the sacraments, bury
the dead; in short, to perform the offices of the Curate,
since there are no other priests in these quarters.
And in truth it would be much better if we were
more earnest workers here for Our Lord, since sailors,
who form the greater part of our parishioners
are ordinarily quite deficient in any spiritual feeling,
having no sign of religion except in their oaths
and blasphemies, nor any knowledge of God beyond
the simplest conceptions which they bring with
them from France, clouded with licentiousness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
the cavilings and revilings of heretics. Hence it
can be seen what hope there is of establishing a
flourishing christian church by such evangelists.
The first things the poor Savages learn are oaths
and vile and insulting words; and you will often hear
the women Savages (who otherwise are very timid
and modest), hurl vulgar, vile, and shameless epithets
at our people, in the French language; not that
they know the meaning of them, but only because
they see that when such words are used there is
[47] generally a great deal of laughter and amusement.
And what remedy can there be for this evil
in men whose abandonment to evil-speaking (or cursing)
is as great as or greater than their insolence in
showing their contempt?</p>

</div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p>A ces exercices chrestiens que nous faisons icy à
l'habitation, assistent aucune fois les Sauvages, quand
aucuns y en a dans le port. Ie dis, aucune fois, d'autant
qu'ils n'y sont gueres stylés, non plus les baptisés
que les payens, ne sçachant gueres davantage les uns
que les autres faute d'instruction. Telle fut la cause
pourquoy nous resolusmes dés nostre arrivée de ne
point baptiser aucun adulte, sans que prealablement
il ne fust bien catechisé. Or catechiser ne pouvons-nous
avant que sçavoir le langage.</p>
</div>
<div class="translation">

<p>At these christian services which we conduct here
at the settlement, the Savages are occasionally present,
when some of them happen to be at the port.
I say, occasionally, inasmuch as they are but little
trained in the principles of the faith&mdash;those who

former, from lack of instruction, knowing but little

they were previously well catechized. Now in
order to catechize we must first know the language.</p>

<p>It is true that Monsieur de Biancourt, who understands

But, somehow, as soon as we begin to talk about God
he feels as Moses did,&mdash;his mind is bewildered, his
throat dry, his tongue tied. The reason for this
is that, as the savages have no definite religion,

magistracy or government, liberal or mechanical arts,

And as to all the virtues you may enumerate to
them, <em>wisdom, fidelity, justice, mercy, gratitude, piety</em>,

good heart</em>. Likewise they will name to you a wolf, a
fox, a squirrel, a moose, and so on to every kind of
animal they have, all of which are wild, except the

thousand gesticulations and signs to express to them
our ideas, and thus to draw from them the names of
some of the things which cannot be pointed out [49]

to doubt; to know these four words, you will be
obliged to amuse our gentlemen for a whole afternoon

I say language and reason, because it is evident
that where words, the messengers and dispensers
of thought and speech, remain totally rude, poor
and confused, it is impossible that the mind and
reason be greatly refined, rich, and disciplined.
However, these poor weaklings and children consider
themselves [50] superior to all other men, and they
would not for the world give up their childishness

a dead dog. They spoke like this because they are
accustomed to abandon altogether those whom they

Christianity and their ungodliness. We had this
poor skeleton brought into one of the cabins of the

ill. Monsieur de Potrincourt, as he was

being a kind-hearted gentleman, had asked him to
let himself be taken to the settlement for treatment.
I was expecting this suggestion [52] to be carried
out; but they did nothing of the kind. When this
became evident, not to leave this soul in danger, I
went there after a few days (for it was five leagues
from the settlement). But I found my patient in a
fine state. They were just about to celebrate tabagie,
or a solemn feast, over his last farewell. Three
or four immense kettles were boiling over the fire.
He had his beautiful robe under him (for it was
summer), and was preparing for his funeral oration.
The oration was to close with the usual adieus and
lamentations of all present. The farewell and the
mourning are finished by the slaughter of dogs, that
the dying man may have forerunners in the other
world. This slaughter is accompanied by the tabagie
and what follows it&mdash;namely, the singing and dancing.
After that it is no longer lawful for the sick man
to eat or to ask any help, but he must already consider
himself one of the "manes," or citizens of the other
world. Now it was in this state that I found my host.</p>

God to prove their despair unfounded; for a few
days afterwards he was in good health and is so to-day
(to God be the glory); which M. Hébert, of
Paris, a well-known master in Pharmacy, who attended
the said patient, often assured me was a
genuine miracle. For my part, I scarcely know what
to say; inasmuch as I do not care either to affirm or
deny a thing of which I have no proof. This I do
know, that we put upon the sufferer a bone taken
from the precious relics of the glorified Saint Lawrence,
archbishop of Dublin in Ireland, which M. de
la Place, the estimable abbé d'Eu, and the Priors and
Canons of the said abbey d'Eu, kindly gave us for
our protection during the voyage to these lands.

so narrow that when three people are in it they can
scarcely turn around, nevertheless, showing his implicit
confidence in us, he asked to be placed in one

afterwards his wife, daughter, and daughter-in-law

leaving, and did so with profuse excuses, asking our

waiting upon him day and night. Certainly the
change of location and treatment did not improve

"Learn our language quickly, for as soon as thou

often escaped drowning, and only recently upon the
blessed day of last Pentecost. He showed but little
gratitude for this favor. Not to make the story too
long, the evening before St. Peter's and St. Paul's
day, as they were discoursing upon the perils of the
sea, and upon the vows made to the Saints in similar
dangers, this wretch began impudently to laugh and
to sneer, jeering at those of the company who were
said to have been religious upon such occasions. He
soon had his reward. The next morning a gust of

the waves, and he was never seen again.</p>

de Biancourt to take this route: first, in order to
have news of the English, and to find out if it would be
possible to obtain satisfaction from them; secondly,
to buy some armouchiquoys corn to help us pass the
winter, and not die of hunger in case we did not receive

<p>Pour entendre la première cause, faut sçavoir que

(ainsy parle-t-on pour parler doucement) et la
promesse qu'il fit d'obtemperer aux prohibitions à

<div class="translation">

<p>To understand the first cause you must know that,
a little while before, captain Platrier, of Honfleur,
already mentioned, wishing to go to Kinibéqui, was
taken prisoner by two English ships which were at
an island called Emmetenic,<a name="endanchor_85a._85a" id="endanchor_85a._85a"></a><a href="#endnote_85._85" class="endanchor">85</a> eight leagues from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Kinibéqui. His release was effected by means of
presents (this expresses it mildly), and by his promise
to comply with the interdictions laid upon him not
to trade anywhere upon all [62] this coast. For the
English want to be considered masters of it, and
they produced letters from their King to this effect,
but these we believe to be false.</p>

<p>Or Monsieur de Biancourt ayant ouy tout cecy de

de cette usurpation des Anglois tant contrariante
aux droits et possessions de sa Majesté. "Car,
disoit-il, il est à tous notoire (pour ne reprendre l'affaire
de plus hault) que le grand Henry, que Dieu
absolve, suyvant les droicts acquis par ses prédecesseurs
et luy, donna à Monsieur des Monts, l'an 1604,
toute cette région depuis le 40<sup>e</sup> degré d'élévation jusques

des Monts, par soy mesme et par Monsieur de Potrincourt,
mon très-honoré pere, son lieutenant, et par
autres, a prins souvent reelle possession de toute la

<p>Now, Monsieur de Biancourt, having heard all this
from the mouth of captain Platrier himself, remonstrated
earnestly with these people, showing how
important it was to him, an officer of the Crown and
his father's Lieutenant, and also how important to
all good Frenchmen, to oppose this usurpation of the
English, so contrary to the rights and possessions of
his Majesty. "For," said he, "it is well known to
all (not to go back any farther in the case) that the
great Henry, may God give him absolution, in accordance
with the rights, acquired by his predecessors
and by himself, gave to Monsieur des Monts, in the
year 1604, all this region from the 40th to the 46th
parallel of latitude. Since this donation, the said
Seigneur des Monts, himself and through Monsieur de
Potrincourt, my very honored father, his lieutenant,
and through others, has frequently taken actual possession
of all the country; and this, three or four
years before the English had ever frequented it, or
before anything had ever been heard of these claims
of theirs." This and several other things were said

We arrived at Kinibéqui, eighty leagues from Port
Royal, the 28th of October, the day of St. Simon and
St. Jude, of the same year, 1611. Our people at once
disembarked, wishing to see the English fort, for
we had learned, on the way, that there was no one
there. Now as everything is beautiful at first, this
undertaking of the English had to be praised and extolled,
and the conveniences of the place enumerated,
each one pointing out what he valued the most. But
a few days afterward they changed their views; for
they saw that there was a fine opportunity for making
a counter-fort there, which might have imprisoned
them and cut them off from the sea and river;
moreover, even if they had been left unmolested they
would not have enjoyed the advantages of the river,
since it has several other mouths, and good ones,
some distance from there. Furthermore, what is
worse, we do not believe that, in six leagues of the
surrounding country, there is a single acre of good
tillable land, the soil being nothing but stones and
rocks. Now, inasmuch as the wind forced us to go
on, when the third day came, Monsieur de Biancourt
[64] considered the subject in council and decided to
take advantage of the wind and go on up the river,
in order to thoroughly explore it.</p>

cursed tyrant, I had our people sing [65] some sacred
hymns, as the <em>Salve</em>, the <em>Ave Maris Stella</em>, and others.
But when they once got into the way of singing, the
spiritual songs being exhausted, they took up others
with which they were familiar. When they came to
the end of these, as the French are natural mimics,
they began to mimic the singing and dancing of the
Armouchiquois who were upon the bank, succeeding
in it so well that the Armouchiquois stopped to listen
to them; and then our people stopped and the others
immediately began again. It was really very comical,
for you would have said that they were two choirs
which had a thorough understanding with each other,

<p>In the morning we continued our journey up the
river. The Armouchiquois, who were accompanying
us, told us that if we wanted any <em>piousquemin</em> (corn),
it would be better and easier for us to turn to the

going up the river; that if we turned to the

they themselves were going to visit him.</p>

the sounder called out to us: "Two fathoms of

such crowds and with such greediness, that they immediately
filled the whole ship, becoming all mixed

restrained him was that I was outside, and if they
came to blows I was lost. God rewarded him for his
good-will by saving not only me but also the whole

excuse the misconduct of the morning, protesting
that all the disorder had originated not with him,
but with the Armouchiquois; that they had even
stolen a hatchet and a platter (a great wooden dish),
which articles he herewith returned; that this theft
had so displeased him that immediately after discovering
it he had sent the Armouchiquois away from
him; that, for his part, he was friendly towards us
and knew very well that [70] we neither killed nor
beat the Savages of those parts, but received them
at our table and often made tabagie for them, and
brought them a great many nice things from France,
for which courtesies they loved us. These people

<p>Mais, d'autant que j'ay faict icy mention des Anglois,
quelqu'un peut estre desirera de sçavoir leur

est doncques ainsy, que l'an 1608 les Anglois commencerent
à s'habituer en l'une des embouschures de ce
fleuve Kinibéqui, ainsy que nous avons dict cy devant.
Ils avoyent lors un conducteur fort honneste homme,
et se comportoit fort bien avec les naturels du païs.
On dit neantmoins que les Armouchiquois se craignirent
de tels voysins, et à cette cause firent mourir
ce capitaine que j'ay dit. Ces gens ont ce mestier
en usage, de tuer par magie. Or la seconde année
1609 les Anglois, soubs un autre capitaine, changerent
de façon. Ils repoussoient les Sauvages sans aucun
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
honneur; ils les battoyent, excedoyent et mastinoyent
sans beaucoup de retenue: partant ces pauvres malmenés,
impatiens du present, et augurants encores

de tuer le louveteau avant qu'il eust des dents et griffes
plus fortes. La commodité leur en fust un jour, que
[71] trois chaloupes s'en estoyent allées à l'escart en

s'approchans avec beau semblant d'amitié (car ainsy

son homme et le tua à coups de cousteau. Ainsy
furent despeschez onze Angloys. Les autres intimidés
abandonnerent leur entreprise cette mesme année,
et ne l'ont point poursuyvie depuis, se contentans
de venir l'esté en pescherie en cette isle d'Emetenic,

<div class="translation">

<p>But as I have spoken here of the English, some
one perhaps will wish to hear about their adventure,
which was related to us in this place. So here it is:
In 1608 the English began to settle at one of the
mouths of this Kinibéqui river, as we have said before.
They had then as leader a very honest man,
who got along remarkably well with the natives of
the country. They say, however, that the Armouchiquois
were afraid of such neighbors, and so put
the captain to death, as I have said. These people
make a practice of killing by magic. But the second year,
1609, the English, under another captain,
changed their tactics. They drove the Savages away
without ceremony; they beat, maltreated and misused
them outrageously and without restraint; consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
these poor, abused people, anxious about
the present, and dreading still greater evils in the
future, determined, as the saying is, to kill the whelp
ere its teeth and claws became stronger.<a name="endanchor_5._5" id="endanchor_5._5"></a><a href="#endnote_5._5" class="endanchor">5</a>
The opportunity
came one day when [71] three boat-loads of
them went away off to the fisheries. My conspirators
followed in their boat, and approaching with a great
show of friendliness (for they always make the greatest
show of affection when they are the most treacherous),
they go among them, and at a given signal
each one seizes his man and stabs him to death.
Thus were eleven Englishmen dispatched. The
others were intimidated and abandoned their enterprise
the same year; they have not resumed it since,
being satisfied to come in the summer to fish, at this
island of Emetenic, which we have said was eight
leagues from the fort they had begun building.</p>

rights. This he did, erecting at the harbor a beautiful
cross bearing the arms of France. Some of his
crew advised him to burn the boats which he found
there; but as he is kind and humane he would not
do it, seeing they were fishermen's boats and not
men-of-war.</p>

all the interpreters were busy. Truly I was very
glad that the goodness of God was beginning to
make these poor and abandoned people feel that in
the sign of the holy and salutary Cross there was
every good and every blessing.</p>

<p>Finally, not to continue repeating the same story,
both in this place and in all others, where we have

attempted to impress upon them some of the simplest

conceptions of the grandeur and truth of Christianity,
in so far as our means would permit. And to sum it
up in a word, this has been the result of our journey.
We have begun to know and to be known, we have
taken possession of these regions in the name of the
Church of God, establishing here the royal throne of
our Savior and King, Jesus Christ, his holy altar;
the Savages have seen us pray, celebrate the mass,
and preach; through our conversations, pictures, and
crosses, our way of living, and other similar things,
they have received the first faint ideas and germs of
our holy faith, which will some day take root and
grow abundantly, please God, if it is followed by a
longer and better cultivation.</p>

see these little Savages, though not yet christians,

candles, bells, holy water and other things, marching
in good order in the processions and funerals
which occur here. Thus they become accustomed to
act as christians, to become so in reality in his time.</p>

<p>The end of this year 1611, which is already so
rapidly drawing near, invites me to write to your
Reverence in acknowledgment of its beginning, in
which our Society first penetrated into this territory
of new France. The profusion of blessings and
favors which the divine bounty has bestowed upon
us while undertaking and sustaining this infant enterprise,
requires that in this haven, as it were, of
time and of the year we should, reviewing the course
of our actions and the occurrences of our voyage, invite
our dear Fathers and Brothers to share both in
our rejoicing for those things which the hand of God
has happily [6] effected through us, and, too, in our
mourning and our prayers for our delinquencies and
inefficiency in seeking the salvation of souls. The
object sought by the Society for a long time previously
and with many efforts, that it might in some
degree impart help and light to this savage people
also by its labors in bringing the Gospel among
them, it seems at last to have attained in this year,
with a small and slight beginning indeed, yet auspiciously
and in accordance with its hopes.</p>

whole narration, and to obviate the possible omission
of many details in its course, I think it best to divide
the whole matter under four heads. I shall therefore
first describe new France, the country, the natives,
and their customs; next, in what manner, and
with what help, and with what result, our Society
secured a mission to this country; [7] thirdly, in what

and explain first what sort of a land New France is,

the whole territory be rather accurately described.
For, since this is the field assigned to us for our
labors, it is certain that your reverence cannot
direct us in accordance with our varied needs without
a knowledge of the extent of the country, of the
impediments to travel, of the distance of neighboring
settlements, and of the condition of people and

This tribe is very savage, and,

in very peaceful relations with the French for a considerable
length of time, it is now on a footing of
irreconcilable enmity. There follow, in the interior,
toward the west, the Algonquins; then the Montagnais;
those dwelling at the head-waters of this

<p>These Irocois are known to the French chiefly
for the perpetual warfare which they maintain
against the Montagnais and Algonquins, allied [10]
and friendly tribes. To the South, however, the coast
gradually advances up to the forty-third degree,
where once more it is interrupted by a very large
bay called French bay. This gulf, advancing far
into the interior, and bending toward the North and
the gulf of St. Lawrence, forms a sort of Isthmus;
and this Isthmus is completed by the St. John, a very
long river which, taking its rise almost at the very
banks of the great Canadian river, empties into this
French bay. This Isthmus has a circuit of fully five
hundred leagues and is occupied by the Soriquois
tribe. In this Isthmus is port royal, where we are
now sojourning, lying on the parallel of 44° 40'. But
this port (to obviate misunderstanding) is not on the
Ocean lying eastward, but on that gulf which I have
called French bay. To the West and north, from the
river of St. John to the river Potugoët,<a name="endanchor_3a._3a" id="endanchor_3a._3a"></a><a href="#endnote_3._3" class="endanchor">3</a>
and even to
the river Rimbegui,<a name="endanchor_2a._2a" id="endanchor_2a._2a"></a><a href="#endnote_2._2" class="endanchor">2</a>
live the Etheminqui. The
mouth of this river is in latitude 43° 40'. [11] Not far
distant is Chouacoët,<a name="endanchor_11._11" id="endanchor_11._11"></a><a href="#endnote_11._11" class="endanchor">11</a>
which is the other shore
or arm embracing French Bay. For to the east
lies what we call cape sable, while Chouacoët
lies toward the West; both are on the forty-third
parallel, though they are separated by an interval
of a hundred leagues. From the Rimbegui<a name="FNanchor_III._4" id="FNanchor_III._4"></a><a href="#Footnote_III._4" class="fnanchor">[III.]</a> river
to the fortieth parallel the whole country is in the
possession of the tribe called the Armouchiquois.
Such is the distribution of the territory. The tribes
amount to seven in number, differing from each other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
in language and character: the Excommunicated, the
Algonquins, the Montagnais, the Irocois, the Soriquois,
the Etheminqui and the Armouchiquois. But
of these neither the Excommunicated, nor the Irocois,
nor the Armouchiquois are well known to the
French. The remaining four tribes appear already
to be united in firm friendship and intimacy with
them. They stay over night among us; we rove
about with them, and hunt with them and live
among them without arms and without fear; and, as
has thus far appeared, without danger. This intimacy
arose partly from association while fishing for
Cod, [12] which abound in these waters, and partly from
trading in furs. For the Savages, who have neither
copper, iron, hemp, wool, vegetables nor manufactured
articles of any kind, resort to the French for
them, giving in return the only thing of value they
have, namely, furs. This whole region is for the
most part very cold, owing to various causes. In
the first place, the country is a very wet one; for,
besides being washed on almost every side by the
sea, it abounds in rivers and ponds and large lakes.
Islands are so numerous that the whole shore is cut
up by a confused procession of them, as it were.
Moreover, though a land of frost, it is very windy,
the wind being nearly always a cold one. Another
cause of cold is the wildness of the country; for, being
covered on every side by one continuous forest,
it naturally follows that the soil hardly ever becomes
really warmed through. A third cause is the mountains,
covered with snow and perpetual frost, which
are said to wall us in far away to the North and the
West.</p>

<p>We certainly get nothing from that quarter but
piercing winds and snow-storms. Elsewhere, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the appearance of the country is very pleasing,
and in many [13] places inviting to the settler and
quite promising; and, as experience has shown, it is
not unfruitful if cultivated. The natives are not numerous.
The Etheminqui number less than a thousand,
the Algonquins and the Montagnais together
would not amount to much more, the Soriquois would
not amount to two thousand. Thus four thousand
Indians at most roam through, rather than occupy,
these vast stretches of inland territory and sea-shore.
For they are a nomadic people, living in the forests
and scattered over wide spaces, as is natural for those
who live by hunting and fishing only. They are
nearly all beardless and of average stature, or even
a little shorter and more slender than we, but not
degraded nor ill-favored in appearance; their color is
not very swarthy; they commonly paint their faces,
and, when in mourning, blacken them. They love
justice and hate violence and robbery, a thing really
remarkable in men who have neither laws nor magistrates;
for, among them, each man is his own master
and his own protector. They have Sagamores, that
is, leaders in war; but their authority is most precarious,
if, indeed, that may be called authority to which
obedience is in no wise obligatory. The Indians follow
them through the persuasion of example or of custom,
[14] or of ties of kindred and alliance; sometimes
even through a certain authority of power, no doubt.
They wage war as a tribe on account of wrongs done
to a private individual. The whole race is very revengeful
and, after the fashion of savages, insolent
in victory, carrying about the heads of their captives
as trophies and spoils of victory.</p>

<p>Their whole religion consists of certain incantations,
dances and sorcery, which they have recourse
to, it seems, either to procure the necessaries of life
or to get rid of their enemies; they have Autmoinos,
that is, medicine-men, who consult the evil Spirit
regarding life and death and future events; and the
evil spirit [great beast] often presents himself before
them, as they themselves assert, approves or disapproves
their schemes of vengeance, promises them
the death of their enemies or friends, or prosperity
in the chase, and other mockeries of the same sort.
To make these complete they [15] even have faith in
dreams; if they happen to awake from a pleasing and
auspicious dream, they rise even in the middle of
the night and hail the omen with songs and dances.
They have no temples, sacred edifices, rites, ceremonies
or religious teaching, just as they have no
laws, arts or government, save certain customs and
traditions of which they are very tenacious. If the
Medicine-man predicts that a certain person will die
before a fixed date, this man is deserted by all; and,
in his misery, feeling certain of impending death, he
voluntarily condemns himself to suffer hunger and
complete neglect, apparently that he may not seem
to contend against fate.</p>

<p>If, however, he does not appear to be in a dying
condition by the time predicted, his friends and relatives
even hasten his death by pouring jars of cold
water over his stomach. Such is the piety of these
servants of Satan. Thus, no doubt because he is
always deceitful, the soothsayer never appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
deceive himself; although this lying race of prophets
have lost much of their authority since the coming of
the French, and now universally complain that their
Devils have lost much of their power, [16] if compared
with what it is said to have been in the time of their
Ancestors. They so completely bury the very remembrance
of the dead with their bodies that they
will not even suffer their names to be mentioned afterwards.
Of the one supreme <span class="smcap">God</span> they have a certain
slender notion, but they are so perverted by false
ideas and by custom, that, as I have said, they really
worship the Devil. To obtain the necessaries of life
they endure cold and hunger in an extraordinary
manner. During eight or ten days, if the necessity
is imposed on them, they will follow the chase in
fasting, and they hunt with the greatest ardor when
the snow is deepest and the cold most severe. And
yet these same Savages, the offspring, so to speak, of
Boreas and the ice, when once they have returned
with their booty and installed themselves in their
tents, become indolent and unwilling to perform any
labor whatever, imposing this entirely upon the
women. The latter, besides the onerous rôle of
bearing and rearing the children, also transport the
game from the place where it has fallen; they are
the hewers of wood and drawers of water; they make
and repair the household utensils; they prepare food;
they skin the game and prepare the hides like fullers;
they sew garments; they catch fish and gather shellfish
for food; often [17] they even hunt; they make
the canoes, that is, skiffs of marvelous rapidity, out
of bark; they set up the tents wherever and whenever
they stop for the night&mdash;in short, the men concern
themselves with nothing but the more laborious
hunting and the waging of war. For this reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
almost every one has several wives, and especially
the Sagamores, since they cannot maintain their
power and keep up the number of their dependents
unless they have not only many children to inspire
fear or conciliate favor, but also many slaves to perform
patiently the menial tasks of every sort that
are necessary. For their wives are regarded and
treated as slaves. These Savages are extremely
liberal toward each other; no one is willing to enjoy
any good fortune by himself, but makes his friends
sharers in the larger part of it; and whoever receives
guests at what they call a Tabagie does not
himself sit down with the others, but waits on them,
and does not reserve any portion of the food for himself
but distributes all; so that the host is constrained
to suffer hunger during that day, unless some one of
his guests takes pity on him [18] and gives him back
a portion of what remains over from his own share.
And they have often shown the same liberality toward
the French, when they have found them in
distress. For they have learned from us that, toward
others than these, whether here or in the ships,
nothing is readily given away. They hunt after the
lice in their heads and regard them as a dainty.
They are most importunate beggars and, after the
fashion of beggars and needy people, they are hypocritical&mdash;contradicting,
flattering and lying to achieve
their ends. But when once they have gotten their fill
they go off, mocking the French and everybody else
at a distance and secretly laughing at everything, even
the religion which they have received. They set up
their tents easily and quickly in any place with
branching stakes, which they cover either with bark
or skins or even with mats. The fire is built in the
middle. But this is enough, and more than enough,

<p>Now I shall enter upon my second topic and explain
by what means the Society finally secured the
sending of a mission to this province. It is true that
our adherents at [19] Bordeaux, in their zeal for the
saving of souls, had looked forward to this, and had
aimed at this for many years back, namely, at bringing
help to this wretched race. But their pious and
ardent efforts, which recoiled before no danger,
were long frustrated by lack of means for prosecuting
them. When our Society was at last re-admitted
into France, they began to negotiate in earnest with
Henry the Great, through Father Coton, to obtain
permission to labor in these regions also, and the
King, so full of good-will toward our Society, espoused
this pious and important project; but, nevertheless,
the taking of active steps was preceded
by a long and vexatious delay. No Frenchmen as
yet inhabited this region with the purpose of settling
here, and such as had been sent by the King as explorers
and in a tentative way, being indifferent to
our holy aims, had soon returned to France, leaving
these things not only unaccomplished but even almost
hopeless. But our Prince, undeterred by these considerations,
bade us be of good heart, and promised,
if we would but designate those who were to be sent,
that he would let us know when he deemed the time
opportune; and, as an earnest of his promise, from
that time forward he assigned to us a sum of money
for the [20] voyage. But at this point, unhappily,
occurred the tragic death of the King. Yet at this
very season <span class="smcap">God</span> came to our help. Some messengers

<p>This man is Jean Biencourt, commonly called Potrincourt,
of noble birth and a magnanimous man.
Accordingly, seizing this opportunity, we made overtures
to the Queen Regent, Marie de Médicis, that
most pious and exalted lady, begging her to execute
what her husband had so piously purposed by giving
a place to two of our Fathers in the ship which was
to sail shortly for this place. The Queen assented,
and responded to our request most liberally. Accordingly
one Priest was immediately summoned
from Aquitaine, and another was chosen in France.
But lo! Satan rouses himself again, and again interposes
new delay. We were to sail from Dieppe, but
the ship that was to bear us to this country was so
completely under the influence of Heretical merchants
that it could not stir without their consent. Accordingly,
as soon as they saw our Priests they refused
outright to let the ship sail if the Jesuits were to embark
in it. The order of the [21] Queen was alleged,
and the authority of the Governor was interposed.
Recourse was had to the Queen, and letters and
orders were obtained from her; but even Royal authority
is, like that of the Church, unable to break
or bend heretical obstinacy. This stubborn resistance
lent all the more lustre to the piety of our
benignant Rulers. For Antoinette de Pons, Marchioness
de Guercheville, a most illustrious lady, and
governess to the daughters of the Queen, on learning
these petty hindrances did not hesitate, in her love
for <span class="smcap">God</span> and for our Society, to ask in his name for
aid from some of the greatest men in the council of
this realm, that the contumacy of the heretics might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
be subdued and the Jesuits permitted to sail to this
land. Nor did she have any difficulty in gaining the
good-will of the Catholic Princes, inclined of their
own accord to sympathize with this holy cause; in a
word, the sum of four thousand livres was collected.
This not only put an end to the iniquitous resistance
of the heretics, but gave our Priests the influence of
Masters rather than of mere passengers in the ship.
Thus, no doubt Christ, as usual, has strengthened
his own followers through the attacks of enemies; [22]
through their iniquity he has furnished aid to his
own children and protected them from the darkness
and the baseness of their foes, even through their
intrigues and insult; his be the glory forever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p>We sailed from Dieppe in a most unfavorable season,
on the 26th of January, of this year 1611. The
ship was not large and was insufficiently equipped;
the sailors were mostly heretics. As it was winter
and the sea was stormy, we encountered many severe
tempests and the voyage lasted four whole months,
from which it is apparent how many sufferings of
every kind we underwent. Indeed, during the greater
portion of the voyage one or the other of us lay sick
and debilitated. Yet we attempted to discharge the
usual duties, of our Society. Morning and evening,
every day, the passengers were called together for
prayer; on holidays certain Ecclesiastical services
were held, pious exhortations were frequently made,
and sometimes disputations with the heretics took
place. The habit of swearing and using obscene language
was repressed. Nor were there wanting many

<div class="translation">
<p><span class="smcap">Now follows</span> the third of the topics proposed in
the beginning&mdash;the setting forth, namely, of the
condition in which we found the Christian religion in
this country. Certainly before this time scarcely any
attention has ever been given by the French to converting
the souls of the natives to Christ. There
have been many obstacles. For the French only
wandered through these regions, but did not remain
here, and those who wished to remain were harassed
by so many calamities that they assuredly could not
give much thought to this matter. Some natives, it
is true, were occasionally brought to France and baptized
there, but these not being sufficiently instructed,
and finding themselves without shepherds as
soon as they returned to these shores, immediately
resumed their former habits and traditions. We
landed here [24] on the 22nd of May, on the holyday
of Pentecost of this year 1611. In this very same year
Sieur Potrincourt, whom I shall have occasion to
mention several times, had come here to establish
himself permanently, and had brought a secular
Priest with him. This Priest, it is said, baptized
nearly a hundred persons during the year, among
them one of the most celebrated of the Chiefs, of
whom we shall have to speak again later, Henry
Membertou, with his whole family, that is, three
children already married. But, since neither this
Priest nor any one else knew their language, save so
far as pertains to the merest necessities of intercourse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
and trade, the neophytes could of course not be instructed
in our doctrines.</p>

<p>They accepted baptism as a sort of sacred pledge
of friendship and alliance with the French. As regards
Christ, the Church, the Faith and the Symbol,
the commandments of <span class="smcap">God</span>, prayer and the Sacraments,
they knew almost nothing; nor did they know
the sign of the cross or the very name of Christian.
So, even now, whenever we ask any one, "Are
you a Christian?" every one of them answers that
he does not understand what [25] we are asking him.
But when we change the form of our question and
ask, "Are you baptized?" he assents and declares
himself to be already almost a Norman, for they call
the French in general Normans. In other respects
there is almost no change from the religion of the
Gentiles to Christianity. They keep up the same
manners and traditions and mode of life, the same
dances and rites and songs and sorcery; in fact, all
their previous customs. Concerning the one <span class="smcap">God</span>
and the reward of the just, they have learned some
things, but they declare that they had always heard
and believed thus. We found one little chapel here,
a very small and poor one, but the other dwellings

<div class="translation">
<p><span class="smcap">We arrived</span> here, as already noted, on the 22nd of
May. Accordingly, we have now sojourned here a
little more than seven months. During this period
we have accomplished some work both at home and
abroad. Our first efforts we expended at home, so
that, as far as it lay in our power, there might be no
interruption of Religious services. For the secular
Priest who had preceded us here, immediately on our
arrival, of his own free will and in accordance with a
long-cherished desire, had returned to France. On
Sundays and holydays we celebrate solemn mass and
vespers; we preach and sometimes have processions,
the boys of our children of the forest carrying before
us, when they are present here, tapers and censers
and other sacred utensils. For thus, little by little,
they become accustomed to our ceremonies. Our procession
was, however, a more solemn one on the day of
Corpus Christi when we carried about the [27] blessed
Sacrament. Sieur Potrincourt himself praised highly
our efforts in this, as well as in adorning our chapel as
much as we could, in spite of our great poverty. Since
we have observed that those who had been previously
baptized had gotten scarcely anything else through
their baptism than increased peril, we have restrained
this eager inclination to administer this sacrament
without discrimination, and we insist that no adult
person shall receive it until he has the necessary understanding
of his faith and his profession. So, as
we have thus far been ignorant of the language and
have been unable to explain our doctrines through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
any interpreter, or to commit them to writing, howsoever
great a labor that may prove&mdash;and it will certainly
prove a great one&mdash;the course of the Gospel
is, up to this point, embarrassed by these shoals and
quicksands. We try to persuade the savages to bring
their babes to us for baptism; and this, with <span class="smcap">God's</span>
blessing, they are beginning to do. We have baptized
two boys, and a girl about nine years old. This
girl was wasting away as much from hunger and
neglect as from sickness; for this people very readily
despair [28] of relief in sickness, and, as previously
stated, soon abandon those whose recovery is deemed
hopeless. Thus, when this girl was given up by
her relatives, we asked that she be given us for baptism.
They very willingly gave her to us, not only
for baptism but to dispose of at our pleasure as being,
they said, no longer of more value than a dead
dog. But we, to show them an example of Christian
piety, carried her to a separate cabin and there fed
her and cared for her; and, after teaching her as
much as was necessary for one struggling with
death, we cleansed her with the saving waters. On
her death, nine days later, we entertained the glad
hope that our labor had found some favor in heaven.
We soon found opportunity for another deed of
charity not dissimilar to this, though its result was
more auspicious. This was in the case of the second
son of that famous Chief Membertou, whom I have
already mentioned as having received our doctrines
first of all the Soriquois.</p>

<div class="translation">
<p>I went to visit this chief's son, who was already at
death's door. I found that, in accordance with their
old custom, they were holding a tabagie, that is, a
solemn feast for the distribution of his property, so
that after the entertainment he might, not like Jacob
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
give them his blessing, [29] but might bid them
farewell, after which they were to bewail his death
and then to offer up a sacrifice of dogs. I rebuked
as well as I could, through an interpreter, these
pagan usages among a people who were already
Christians. The father himself, Membertou,
answered mildly that they were but neophytes; that I
had but to command and that everything lay in my
power. I said that this slaughtering of dogs was
wrong, as well as this abandonment of the sick man
for whom they were mourning; I added that these
dances and death-songs, in the very presence of the
sick man displeased me, though I permitted them to
hold their tabagie elsewhere, as well as to visit the
dying man and learn his last wishes. All replied
that this was enough for them, and that they would
dispense with the rest. Moreover, in the name of
Sieur Potrincourt I invited them to transport to his
house the sick man (who was at a very great
distance), and said that we hoped, with <span class="smcap">God's</span> mercy,
for his recovery, so that they might thus learn at last
that the predictions of their medicine-men or prophets
are false and impious. They obeyed, and the
third day after brought to us the sufferer, whose life
they had despaired of, in a half-dying condition.
God's right hand exerted its power; he did not die,
but lived, and now, completely recovered, relates what
[30] God has done for him. Moved by this example,
the elder Membertou himself, when he began to
suffer from that sickness which was to be his last,
desired of his own accord to be brought to us and to
be received into our own cabin, and even, if it pleased
us, to occupy one of our beds. He lay there five
days, during which we performed every friendly
and even every menial office. But on the sixth day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
when his wife had also come, and when she saw that
there was scarcely room left for one of us to find a
wretched couch on the ground in our cabin, he, of his
own accord, went elsewhere, and there died a pious
death. We found, indeed, that this man (the first
fruits of the Lord among this people) was, beyond all
others, wont to be so wondrously moved within, that
he apprehended much more of our faith than he
could have learned from hearing us. Thus he used
to say frequently that he ardently desired that we
might soon know his language. He said that as soon
as he had learned them thoroughly he would become
the preacher of this heavenly word and doctrine
among his people. He himself had commanded that
he should be buried in the ancient burial-place of his
family, with those who were already dead (who, I
knew, had died as pagans). [31] I opposed this, fearing,
of course, that the French and even the Gentiles
might interpret this as an affront to our faith. But
he answered that it had been promised him, before he
gave himself to Christ, that this place should be consecrated;
and he cited a past example of something of
the sort, adding that he feared, on the contrary, that
if he were buried in our cemetery his people might
thenceforth avoid the place and thus never return to
us. I opposed all the reasons I could, and so did
Sieur de Biencourt, the son of Sieur de Potrincourt, he
being almost my only interpreter. I went off sadly,
for I had accomplished nothing by arguing. Nevertheless,
I did not refuse him the extreme unction, for
which he was prepared. The power of the Sacrament
manifested itself; the next day he called eagerly
for Sieur de Biencourt and myself, and told us in
the hearing of all the others that he had changed his
mind, and wished to be buried in our cemetery; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to teach his people that they should not avoid the
place in accordance with their old and erroneous
notion, but rather, with the wisdom of a Christian
people, should love and frequent it, in order to utter
pious prayers for him.</p>

<p>Then he recommended to them again [32] and again
to maintain peace with us, and also piously gave
his blessing to certain of his people, I dictating
the words and guiding his hand. A short time after,
he died. We deemed it well to celebrate his funeral
with great pomp. And certainly there has for a long
time been no Chief of such great authority among
these people. What is still more remarkable is that
he always adhered firmly to his resolution never to
have more than one wife at a time, even before his
conversion.</p>

<div class="translation">

<p>Such are the things achieved at home; let us now
consider what has been done elsewhere. I have explored
with Sieur Biencourt a large part of this whole
region&mdash;all that portion, namely, which the old geographers
called Norumbega, including the principal
rivers. The result is that not only have we come to
know the country, but also to be known ourselves,
and the savages, who had never before seen a Priest or
the rites of our Religion, have begun to learn something
concerning it. Wherever and whenever we
could do so, we offered the priceless host to the Omnipotent
<span class="smcap">God</span>, so that the altar might be as a seat
dedicated to the savior of men, whence he should
begin to extend his dominion among this people,
while their own hobgoblin tyrants are stricken with
terror and driven [33] from their usurpation. The
Savages have often been present, always profoundly
silent and reverent. Afterwards I would visit their
huts to pray and to lay hands on the sick; I gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
them little crosses of brass, or images, which I hung
about their necks, and as far as possible I infused
some religious notions into their minds. They received
all these things very gladly, they made the
sign of the Cross under my guidance, and nearly all
the boys followed me a long distance in order to repeat
it oftener. Once it happened that a savage
whom I had visited a couple of days before, finding
him sick and almost given up by his friends, as I
heard, met me rejoicing and well, and glorying in
his cross, manifesting his gratitude toward me with
hands and countenance, so that I strongly suspected
that he had not only experienced the help of the
cross but even recognized it. Whenever we fell in
with French vessels&mdash;and this often happened&mdash;salutary
counsels were given to the men, in accordance
with time and place; sometimes, too, the passengers
made their confession. Sometimes calamities
that threatened the welfare and fortune of many
were averted through the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>; sometimes,
too, [34] certain destruction and the slaughter of no
small number. We have also succeeded in reclaiming
a certain Young Man<a name="endanchor_13a._13a" id="endanchor_13a._13a"></a><a href="#endnote_13._13" class="endanchor">13</a>
of great courage and hope who,
through fear of Sieur de Potrincourt, has roamed about
for a whole year with the Savages, adopting their
ways and dress&mdash;not without suspicion, too, of something
worse. The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> brought about a meeting
between us. I spoke with him, and at last he confided
himself to me. I brought him to Sieur de Potrincourt;
he did not repent of having placed faith in
me; peace was made, to the great joy of all, and
next day the young man, before receiving the holy
Eucharist, of his own free will begged the pardon of
those who surrounded him, for his evil conduct. But
as it would be superfluous to speak of the many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
perils so miraculously escaped by our vessels, so
would it be to speak of the many sufferings of those
who sojourn here. We make no complaint of having
to drink water; as for bread, in less than six weeks the
supply ran so short that now no more is allowed for a
week than formerly for a single day. We are awaiting
a ship that is to bring supplies. In the meantime,
as Bakers and Artisans, a great and ancient quality
withal, [35] we continue living here, but we have
each fallen seriously ill; however, the Lord sustained
us with his hand. For this did not last long, and
whenever one of us was sick the other was well. We
feel, indeed, how great a burden it is to attend to all
these household duties, in going for wood and water,
in cooking, in washing and mending our clothes, in
repairing our cabin, and in giving the necessary time
and attention to other material cares. Thus our
days and nights wretchedly slip away; but the hope
consoles and sustains us that <span class="smcap">God</span>, who raises up
those who are cast down, will some time in his mercy
not despise our unworthiness. Though, certainly,
when we consider our lack of resources, the trying
nature of the country, and the manners of the natives,
the difficulties incident to our undertaking and those
incident to the establishing of a colony, the thousand
perils and impediments interposed by the sea or
by our fellow men, our enterprise seems but a dream
and a Platonic idea. I might set forth all these
things one by one, if this were not to imitate the
Hebrew explorers, and rather with regard to our human
strength than to God's help, and no less through
the [36] faintness of our own hearts than in accordance
with the truth of things, to say: "This land devours
its inhabitants; we are locusts, while there are here
monsters of the race of Giants." But yet, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
great these Giants be, that David with the sling
and stone shall prevail against them, even he who
tramples the earth under foot in his anger, and in
his rage strikes terror into the senses of men; that
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, the Savior of mankind, who blesses the world
and leads it toward perfection in spite of all its shortcomings;
he, even he, as we hope, will deem it a
thing worthy of his love and his power that, as
Isaiah prophesied, <em>The solitude should exult and blossom
like a lily</em>; even as he deemed it good in his wisdom
and his power that, as we see, the most civilized empires
in the height of power and glory should receive
the yoke of his cross and his humility. Amen, so be
it. And may all heaven with its prayers further
this, our hope, and above all the glorious Queen of
heaven; and my own prayers be aided, too, by the
universal Church and especially by that portion of
the Church over which, in accordance with God's
will, your Reverence has so long presided&mdash;the Society;
and I also pray and beseech [37] your Reverence
to further it with all possible aid, and to be
pleased to bestow on us toward this end in all charity
your benediction. From port Royal, in new France,
the last day of January, 1611.</p>

<h4>PREFACE.</h4>

<p class="dropcap">LE proverbe ancien est bien veritable, que les
Dieux nous vendent toutes choses par labeur.
Ceci se reconoit par experience ordinaire en
plusieurs choses, mais particulierement au fait duquel
nous avons à parler: auquel donne sujet par ses incomparables
vertus le sieur de Poutrincourt, de qui
les labeurs plus que Herculeans ont dés y a long temps
merité vne bien ample fortune, &amp; y eust donné
attainte au temps de nos troubles derniers, s'il n'eust
esté trop entier à maintenir le party qu'il auoit embrassé.
Car le Roy le tenant en personne assiegé dans
le chateau de Beaumont [4] lui voulut donner le Comté
dudit lieu pour se rendre à son service. Ce qu'ayant
refusé, il le fit toutefois peu après gratuitement
voyant sa Majesté reduit à l'Eglise Catholique Romaine.
Vray est que nostre feu Roy <span class="smcap">Henri</span> le Grand
l'auoit obligé en vne chose, c'est d'avoir rendu par sa
bouche ce temoignage de lui, qu'il estoit vn des plus
hommes de bien, &amp; des plus valeureux de son royaume.
Suiuant quoy aussi apres noz guerres passées,
lui qui naturellement est porté aux entreprises difficiles,
fuiant la vie oisive, auroit recherché l'occasion
de faire plus que devant paroitre son courage, honorer
son Prince, &amp; illustrer sa patrie. Ce qu'il auroit fait
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
par la rencontre du sieur de Monts, lequel en l'an
1603, entreprenoit le voyage de la France Nouvelle
&amp; Occidentale d'outre mer, auec lequel il se ioignit
pour y reconoistre vne terre propre à habiter &amp; y
rendre service a Dieu &amp; au Roy. A quoy il a depuis
travaillé continuellement &amp; eust desia beaucoup
avancé l'&oelig;uvre, si sa facilité ne se fust trop fiée à des
hommes trompeurs, qui lui ont fait perdre son temps
&amp; son argent. Voire encore estant Gentilhomme indomtable
à la fatigue, &amp; sans crainte aux hazars, il
se pourroit promettre vn assez prompt avancement à
son entreprise s'il n'estoit troublé par l'avarice de
ceux qui lui enlevent la graisse de sa terre sans y faire
habitation, &amp; avides des Castors de ce païs là y vont
exprés pour ce sujet, &amp; ont fait à l'envi l'un de l'autre
que chacune peau de Castor (qui est le traffic le plus
[5] present de ces terres) vaut icy auiourd'hui dix
liures, qui se pourroit bailler pour la moitié, si le commerce
d'icelles estoit permis à vn seul. Et au moyen
de ce pourroit prendre fondement la Religion Chrestienne
par dela; comme certes elle y auroit esté fort
avancée, si telle chose eust esté faite. Et la consideration
de la Religion &amp; de l'establissement d'un païs
dont la France peut tirer du profit &amp; de la gloire, merite
bien que ceux qui l'habitent iouïssent pleinement
&amp; entierement des fruits qui en proviennent, puis
que nul ne contribuë à ce dessein pour le soulagement
des entrepreneurs, lesquels au peril de leurs vies &amp;
de leurs moyens ont découvert par dela tant les orées
maritimes, que le profond des terres, où iamais aucun
Chrétien n'avoit esté. Il y a vne autre consideration
que ie ne veux mettre par écrit, &amp; laquelle seule doit
faire accorder ce que dessus à ceux qui se presentent
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
&amp; offrent pour habiter &amp; defendre la province, voire
pour donner du secours à toute la France de deça.
C'a esté vne plainte faite de tout temps, que les considerations
particulieres ont ruiné les affaires du general.
Ainsi est-il à craindre qu'il n'en avienne en l'affaire
des Terres-neuves, si nous la negligeons, &amp; si
l'on ne soustient ceux qui d'une resolution immuable
s'exposent pour le bien, l'honneur, &amp; la gloire de la
France, &amp; pour l'exaltation du nom de Dieu, &amp; de
son Eglise.</p>

France, twenty months ago.

<h4>PREFACE.</h4>

<p class="dropcap">THE old proverb is true that the Gods sell us all
things for work. This may be recognized in
many of the ordinary events of life, but especially
in the matter of which we are about to speak,
and for which we have a subject in the incomparable
virtues of sieur de Poutrincourt, whose more than
Herculean labors have for a long time deserved a
very ample fortune, which he might have succeeded
in acquiring during our late struggles, had he not
been too entirely devoted to the party which he had
embraced. For the King, holding him besieged in
person in Beaumont castle, [4] wished to give him
the County thereof to attach him to his service. Refusing
the gift at this time, he nevertheless accepted
it freely soon afterwards, when he learned that his
Majesty had embraced the faith of the Roman Catholic
Church. It is true that our late King <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the
Great had rendered him one service; that is, he had
testified with his own lips that he was one of the
most honorable and valiant men in his kingdom.
Again, after our recent wars, being naturally attracted
to difficult enterprises and shunning a life of idleness,
he sought some occasion to more effectually
show his courage, to honor his Prince, and to glorify
his country. This he did by meeting sieur de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Monts,<a name="endanchor_13._13" id="endanchor_13._13"></a><a href="#endnote_13._13" class="endanchor">13</a>
who, in the year 1603, undertook the voyage
to New and Western France beyond the sea; and by
associating himself with him, to find a suitable place
where he could settle down, and there render service
to God and the King. To this end he has labored
continually ever since, and would have already greatly
advanced the work, had not his amiable nature
been imposed upon by dishonest men, who have been
the cause of great losses to him in time and money.
But, as he was a Gentleman not to be conquered by
hardships, and fearing no dangers, he might have
been sure of prompt advancement in his work had he
not been hindered by the greed of those who robbed
him of the fat of his lands, without making any settlement
there. These people, eager to get the Beaver
skins of that country, go there for no other purpose;
and so compete with each other, that they have
caused every Beaver skin (which is the chief traffic
[5] of these regions) to be worth here to-day ten
livres, when they might have been sold for one-half
that price, if the traffic therein had been limited to
one person. In this way the Christian Religion
might have also been established there; and it certainly
would have been greatly advanced, if such a
course had been pursued. Also for the sake of Religion
and of permanent colonization, from which
France can derive both profit and glory, it is well that
those who settle there should enjoy fully and wholly
the advantages guaranteed by them; since no one
does anything in this direction for the sake of the
leaders of the enterprise, who, at the risk of their
lives and their fortunes, have discovered coasts and
interior lands where no Christian had ever been.
There is another consideration which I do not wish
to set down in writing, and which alone ought to obtain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the above-mentioned privileges to those who
present and offer themselves to settle and defend the
province, and indeed to give assistance to the entire
French colony over there. There has always been a
complaint that affairs of general importance are
ruined by giving too much attention to the consideration
of personal interests. It is to be feared this
may be the case in the affairs of the new World, if we
neglect them, and do not encourage those who, with
an unchangeable purpose, take great risks for the welfare,
the honor, and the glory of France, and for the
exaltation of the name of God, and of his Church.</p>

<h4>[6] VOYAGE EN LA TERRE-NEUVE.</h4>

<p>I'ay rapporté en mon histoire de la Nouvelle France
ce qui est des deux premiers voyages faits outre mer
par le sieur de Poutrincourt. Ici i'ay à écrire ce qui
s'est ensuiui és voyages subsequens. Depuis quelques
années une succession lui est echeuë a cause de Dame
Iehanne de Salazar sa mere, qui est la Baronnie de
Sainct Iust en Champagne. Les rivieres de Seine &amp;
d'Aulbe rendent le lieu de cette Baronnie autant agreable,
que fort &amp; avantageux à la defense. Là au commencement
de Février mil six cens dix il fit partie de
son equippage, y ayant chargé vn bateau de meubles,
viures, &amp; munitions de guerre, voire tellement chargé
qu'il n'y restoit que deux doigts de bord hors de
l'eau. Cependant la riviere estoit enflée &amp; ne se pouuoit
plus tenir en son lict à cause des longues pluies
hivernales. Les flots le menaçoient souuent, les perils
y estoient presens, mesmement és passages de Nogent,
Corbeil, Sainct Clou, Ecorche-veau, &amp; autres où
des bateaux perirent à sa veuë, sans qu'il fust aucunement
emeu d'apprehension. En fin il parvint à Dieppe,
&amp; apres quelque sejour il se mit en mer le 26.
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
dudit mois de Février. Plusieurs en cette ville là benissoient

rencontrerent vnze navires Flamens, &amp; se saluerent

8. iusques au 15. il y eut tempéte, durant laquelle vne

vient la paix, Ainsi apres ces tourmentes ils eurent
des calmes iusques au iour de Pasques Fleuries plus
facheux que les tourmentes: car quoy qu'on soit en
repos, il n'y a pourtant sujet de contentement: car les
vivres se mangent, &amp; la saison de bien faire se passe:
bref vn grand calme est fort mauvais sur la mer.
Mais cela n'est point perpetuel: &amp; quelquefois (selon
l'inconstance d'Eole) apres le calme suit vn vent favorable,

<div class="translation">

<h4>[6] VOYAGE TO THE NEW WORLD.</h4>

<p>I related in my history of New France what happened
in the first two voyages made by sieur de
Poutrincourt to the lands beyond the sea. Here I
shall give an account of what took place in the subsequent
voyages. Some years ago an inheritance,
the Barony of Sainct Just, in Champagne, fell to
Sieur de Poutrincourt through his mother, Lady
Jehanne de Salazar. The Seine and Aulbe rivers
render the situation of this domain as beautiful as it
is strong and eligible for defense. Here, in the beginning
of February, one thousand six hundred and
ten, he partly equipped his ship, loading it with furniture,
provisions, and munitions of war; and, indeed,
so freighted it down that the sides were only
two finger-lengths out of the water. Meanwhile,
the river had risen until it could no longer be confined
in its bed, on account of the long winter rains.
Often threatened by floods and by imminent perils
in the passages from Nogent, Corbeil, Sainct Clou,
Ecorche-veau and other places, where vessels were
wrecked before his eyes, he was not in the least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
affected by fear. At last he arrived at Dieppe, and,
after a sojourn there, he put to sea upon the 26th of
this same month of February. Many people of that
city wished him well in his voyage and prayed God
for its success. The season was stormy, and contrary
winds prevailed the greater part of the time. But
we may indeed call a [7] voyage fortunate, which
brings us at last safe into port. <span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup>
<em>Forbans
are pirates.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> They were not far
away when they met, in the direction of Casquet,<a name="endanchor_14._14" id="endanchor_14._14"></a><a href="#endnote_14._14" class="endanchor">14</a> a
ship of Forbans<sup>a</sup>, who, seeing that the Sieur and
his crew were all ready to defend themselves if attacked,
sailed on past them. On the 6th of March they
met eleven Flemish ships, and they saluted each
other by a discharge of cannon. From the 8th to
the 15th there was a tempest, during which the
Sieur, who was lying down on the poop, was thrown
from his bed, over the table, to that of his son.
<span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>b</sup> <em>South,
that is,
Meridian.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> This
bad weather made them turn their route more to the
South<sup>b</sup>, where they saw two of the Essores islands,
Corbes and Flore; and there they had some fresh
food by catching a few Porpoises. And as, according
to the old saying, peace follows war, so, after these
storms, there were calms more trying than the tempests,
until Palm Sunday; for then, although there
was rest, there was no satisfaction in it, for the food
was being consumed and the good season was passing
away; in short, a great calm is a very harmful
thing upon the sea. But it does not last always; and
sometimes (according to the fickle moods of Æolus)
after the calm comes a favorable wind, sometimes a
tempest; as happened shortly afterwards (namely,
the day after Easter), and this caused a leak in the
soute, which is the storeroom for bread or biscuit.
Now the ship's carpenter, who went to repair the
leak, while doing what his trade demanded, interfered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
with the public prayers which were being offered
in the morning, and the Sieur commanded him
[8] to do his work outside. <span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup> <em>Peril of
a carpenter.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> He obeyed, and there
found the Rudder broken (which is a very dangerous
thing); wishing to readjust it, while he was engaged
in the work, he fell<sup>a</sup> from his scaffolding into the
sea. And it was well that the weather had moderated;
for otherwise there would have been a man
lost. But he was rescued by the efforts of the sailors,
who threw him a rope by which he saved himself.</p>

passed, after having encountered several contrary
winds, at last they landed in the neighborhood of
Pemptegoet,<sup>c</sup> (the place that our Geographers designate
by the name Norembega);<a name="endanchor_15._15" id="endanchor_15._15"></a><a href="#endnote_15._15" class="endanchor">15</a>
and the Sieur
caused Mass to be said upon an Island, which he
called Ascension, because they arrived there upon
that day. Thence they came to Sainte Croix,<a name="endanchor_16._16" id="endanchor_16._16"></a><a href="#endnote_16._16" class="endanchor">16</a>
the
first settlement of our French upon this coast, where
the Sieur had prayers offered for the dead who had
been buried there since the first voyage made by
sieur de Monts, in the year 1603. Then they went up
the river Sainte Croix, where they found such a great
number of Herrings at every tide, that they had
enough to feed a whole city. During the other seasons
there are other kinds of fish, but at that time it
was the Herring season. <span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>d</sup> <em>Funeral
ceremonies.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> Also there are trees there
of [9] indescribable beauty, height, and grandeur.
Upon this same coast, before reaching Port Royal,<sup>d</sup>
they saw the funeral ceremonies over the corpse of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
savage who had died in the land of the Etechemins.
The body was resting upon a plank supported by
four stakes and covered with skins. The next day,
a great crowd of men arrived, who performed their
customary dances around the corpse. One of the old
men held a long pole, upon which were dangling three
of their enemies' heads; others carried other trophies
of their victories; and thus they continued to sing
and dance for two or three hours, chanting the praises
of the dead instead of the <em>Libera</em> of Christians.
<span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup> <em>Matachiaz
are necklaces,
scarfs and
bracelets.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
Afterwards each one made him a gift of some kind,
such as skins, kettles, peas, hatchets, knives, arrows,
<sup>a</sup><em>Matachiaz</em>,<a name="endanchor_17._17" id="endanchor_17._17"></a><a href="#endnote_17._17" class="endanchor">17</a>
and articles of apparel. When all
these ceremonies were finished, they carried him
for burial to an isolated island, far from the mainland.
And, leaving there, the Sieur sailed for Port
Royal, the place of his residence.</p>

<h4>RELIGION.</h4>

<p>Sieur de Poutrincourt had hardly taken breath after
so many labors, when he sent for Membertou, chief
and oldest Captain of this country, to refresh his
memory in regard to some of the principles of the
Christian Religion, which we had [10] previously
taught him, and to instruct him more fully in things
which concern the salvation of the soul; so that, he
being converted, many others might follow his example.
As in truth it came to pass. For after having
been catechized for some time, and his family
with him, he was baptized, as were also twenty others
of his company, upon saint John the Baptist's day,
1610. <span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>b</sup> <em>Book 5.
ch. 5.
page 638.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> I have enrolled their names in my History of
New France,<sup>b</sup> just as they are written over there
in the baptismal register of the mother-Church, which
is at Port Royal. The Pastor who accomplished this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
master-piece [<em>chef d'&oelig;uvre</em>] was Messire Jesse Fleuche,
a native of Lantage, in the diocese of Langres;
<span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup> <em>Commission.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
he is a scholarly man, and received his commission
<sup>a</sup>from Monsieur, the Ambassador of the Holy Father,
the Bishop of Rome, who was then, and is still, in
Paris. Not that a French Bishop might not have
given it to him; but, as this one was chosen, I believe
the said commission is as good from him (since he is
a Bishop), as from another, although he is a stranger.
However, I leave the consideration of this matter to
those who have more interest in it than I have, it being
a question that admits of dispute on both sides,
since here he is not in his diocese. This Ambassador,
called Robert Ubaldin,<a name="endanchor_18._18" id="endanchor_18._18"></a><a href="#endnote_18._18" class="endanchor">18</a>
gave him permission to hear
confessions from all people over there, and to absolve
them from all sins and crimes not strictly reserved
to the Apostolic see; and to impose upon them
penances, according to the character of the sin.
Furthermore, he gave him power to consecrate and
bless the chasubles, and other priestly vestments, and
the altar furnishings, except [11] the Corporals, Chalices,
and Patens. It is thus that I have seen it stated
in the credentials granted to the said Fleuche, first
Patriarch of those lands. I say patriarch, because
that is what he was generally called: and this was
an incentive to him to lead a life full of integrity
and innocence, as I believe he has done. Now these
baptismal ceremonies were not without solemnity.
<span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>b</sup> <em>Confession
of Membertou.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> For Membertou (and consequently<sup>b</sup> the others),
before being introduced into the Church of God,
made an examination of all his past life, confessed
his sins, and renounced the devil, whom he had
served. Then each one joined heartily in singing
the <em>Te Deum</em>, and there was a joyful discharge of
cannon, so that the Echoes lingered in Port Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
nearly a quarter of an hour. God has shown great
mercy in granting that this man should receive the
gift of Faith, and the light of the Gospel, at the age
to which he has attained, which is, I believe, one
hundred and ten years, or more. He was named
<span class="smcap">Henry</span>, after our late King, <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the Great.
<span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup> <em>Page 638.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> Others were given the names of the holy Father,
the Pope of Rome, of the Queen, of my Lords and
Ladies, her children, of Monsieur the Nuncio, and of
other notable personages over here, who have been
chosen as godparents, as I have written in my History.<sup>a</sup>
But I do not see that these godparents have remembered
their children, nor that they have sent
them anything to support, aid, and encourage them in
remaining firm in the Religion which they have accepted:
for, if you give them bread, you can make
them believe almost anything you wish; when, little
by little, their land [12] is cultivated, they will derive
from it their support. But they must be assisted
in the beginning. Sieur de Poutrincourt has done
this as far as he was able, even going beyond his
means, for which he fasted afterwards, as we shall
relate elsewhere.</p>

<h4>RETURN TO FRANCE.</h4>

<p>Three weeks after the Sieur's arrival at his estates
in Port Royal, he made up his mind to send back
to France his eldest son, the Baron de sainct Just, a
young Gentleman who is well versed in seamanship,
and whom, upon this occasion, Monsieur the Admiral
has honored with the title of Vice-Admiral of the
Western ocean and its more distant coasts. For, being
obliged to furnish food for a great many men at
least during the space of a year and more, while waiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
for the wheat crop, he needed a new supply of
provisions and merchandise suitable for general use,
both for himself and his people, and for the Savages.
So he had him leave on the 8th of July, enjoining
him to be upon his return voyage in four months;
and he accompanied him in a Pinnace, or large boat,
for about one hundred leagues. At this season it is
pleasant to sail along the coast, for there are a great
many islands in the neighborhood of Cape Fourchu<a name="endanchor_19._19" id="endanchor_19._19"></a><a href="#endnote_19._19" class="endanchor">19</a>
and Cape Sable, which are so full of birds, that all
there is to do is to knock them down and reload;
also, fish are so plentiful, that it is only necessary to
throw out the line and draw it in. Contrary winds,
having several times [13] forced them to cast anchor
among these islands, this gave them an opportunity
of verifying what I have said. So sainct Just continued
to coast along for two hundred leagues, until
he had passed Sable island,<a name="endanchor_20._20" id="endanchor_20._20"></a><a href="#endnote_20._20" class="endanchor">20</a>
a dangerous place because
it is low and has no safe harbor; it is twenty
leagues from the mainland opposite the land of Bacaillos.<a name="endanchor_21._21" id="endanchor_21._21"></a><a href="#endnote_21._21" class="endanchor">21</a>
<span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup> <em>See History

Banks, where he obtained fresh food and met several
ships from our French ports, and one English ship,
whence he received the first news of the death of
our great King <span class="smcap">Henry</span>. This grieved him and his
crew, on account of the sad circumstances surrounding
the death, and because they feared trouble might
arise from it. Sunday, the first day of August, they
left these Banks; on the 20th they sighted the land
of France and on the 21st entered the port of Dieppe.</p>

<h4>AUANCEMENT DE LA RELIGION.</h4>

<p>Comme le sieur de Poutrincourt suivoit la côte conduisant
son fils sur le retour, il trouva quelques Sauvages
de conoissance en vne ile, où ils s'estoient cabannez,
faisans pécherie: lesquels ayant abordé, ils
en furent tout ioyeux: <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup>

en leurs baptizailles,<sup>a</sup> il leur demanda s'ils vouloient
point estre comme luy, &amp; croire en Dieu pour
estre aussi baptizés; A quoy ils [14] s'accorderent
apres avoir esté instruits. Et là dessus il les envoya
au Port Royal pour estre plus à loisir confirmés en la
Foy &amp; doctrine Evangelique: là où estans ils furent
baptizés. Cependant ledit Sieur poursuivoit sa route
allant toujours avant le long de la côte, tant qu'il
vint au Cap de la Héve, environ lequel endroit il
laissa aller à la garde de Dieu ledit sieur de sainct Iust
son fils, &amp; virant le cap en arriere cingla vers la riviere
dudit lieu de la Héve, qui est vn port large de
plus de deux lieuës &amp; long de six, cuidant y trouver
vn Capitaine dés long temps appellé Martin par noz
François. Mais il s'en estoit retiré, à-cause de quelque
mortalité là survenuë par des maladies dysenteriaques.
Depuis, ledit Martin ayant entendu que ledit
Sieur lui avoit fait tant d'honneur que de l'aller
chercher, il le suivit à la piste avec trente-cinq ou 40.
hommes, &amp; le vint trouver vers le Cap de Sable pour
le remercier d'une telle visite. Ledit Sieur homme accort
&amp; benin le receut humainement, encores qu'auparavant
en l'an 1607. il y eust eu quelque colere
contre lui, sur ce que passant icelui Sieur par ledit lieu
de la Héve foible de gens, &amp; se voyant environné de
trois chaloupes de Sauvages pleines de peuple, il les
fit ranger toutes d'un côté. Sur quoy ledit Martin
ayant dit qu'il avoit donc peur d'eux, il fut en danger
de voir par effet que sa conclusion estoit fausse.
<span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>b</sup>
<em>Acte de pieté.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> A cette derniere rencontre ledit Martin fut caressé &amp; invité
à se faire Chrétien, comme Membertou, &amp; <sup>b</sup>plusieurs
autres: &amp; [15] s'en aller au Port Royal pour y
recevoir plus ample instruction. Ce qu'il promit
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
faire avec sa troupe. Et d'autant que les Sauvages
ne vont iamais voir leurs amis les mains vuides, il alla
à la chasse, afin de porter de la venaison audit lieu: &amp;
cependant ledit Sieur s'avance &amp; va devant pour les
y attendre. <span class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>c</sup>
<em>Peril.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> Mais étant environ le Cap Fourchu,<sup>c</sup>
le voila porté d'un vent de terre droit à la mer, &amp; ce si
avant, qu'il fut six iours sans aucune provision de
vivres (que de quelques oiseaux pris és iles, qu'il avoit
de reste) &amp; sans autre eau douce que celle qui se recuilloit
quelquefois dans les voiles: Bref sans rien
voir que ciel &amp; eau; &amp; s'il n'eust eu vne petite boussolle
il estoit en danger d'estre porté à la côte de la
Floride par la violence des vents, des tempétes, &amp; des
vagues. En fin par son industrie &amp; iugement il vint
terrir vers l'ile sainte Croix, là où Oagimont Capitaine
dudit lieu lui apporta des galettes de biscuit
qu'il avoit troquées avec noz François. Et delà
estant en lieu de conoissance il traversa la baye Françoise
large en cet endroit de vingt lieuës, &amp; vint au
Port Royal cinq semaines apres sa departie où il
trouva des gens bien etonnés pour sa longue absence,
&amp; qui desia pourpensoient vn changement qui ne pouvoit
estre que funeste. C'est ainsi qu'au peril de sa
vie, avec des fatigues &amp; souffrances incroyables il va
chercher des brebis egarées pour les amener à la bergerie
de Iesus-Christ, &amp; accroitre le Royaume celeste.
Que si la conversion de ces peuples ne se fait par milliers,
il faut penser [16] que nul Prince ou Seigneur
n'a iusques ici assisté ledit sieur de Poutrincourt, auquel
méme les avares vont ravir ce qui est de sa province,
&amp; sa bonté souffre cela, pour ne faire rien qui
puisse aigrir les grands de deça, encores que le Roy
luy ayant donné la terre il puisse iustement empecher
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
qu'on ne lui enleve les fruits d'icelle, &amp; qu'on n'entre
dans ses ports, &amp; qu'on ne lui coupe ses bois. Quand
il aura de plus amples moyens il pourra envoyer des
hommes aux terres plus peuplées, où il faut aller fort,
&amp; faire vne grande moisson pour l'amplification de
l'Eglise. Mais il faut premierement batir la Republique,
sans laquelle l'Eglise ne peut estre. Et pour
ce le premier secours doit estre à cette Republique,
&amp; non à ce qui a le pretexte de pieté. Car cette Republique
estant établie, ce sera à elle à pourvoir à
ce qui regarde le spirituel. Retournons au Port Royal.
Là ledit Sieur arrivé trouva Martin &amp; ses gens
baptizés, &amp; tous portés d'un grand zele à la Religion
Chrétienne, oyans fort devotement le service divin,
lequel estoit ordinairement chanté en Musique de la
composition dudit Sieur.</p>

<h4>PROGRESS OF RELIGION.</h4>

<p>As sieur de Poutrincourt sailed along the coast,
while accompanying his son upon his return, he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
some Savages whom he knew, encamped upon an
island and engaged in fishing; <span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>a</sup> <em>Act of
piety.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> they were overjoyed
at his arrival, and after some talk about Membertou
and others, and about what had taken place at their
baptism,<sup>a</sup> he asked them if they did not wish to be
like him, to believe in God and be baptized: this they
[14] agreed to do after they had been instructed. And
thereupon he sent them to Port Royal, where more
time could be given to confirm them in the Faith and
doctrines of the Gospel; they went there and were
baptized. Meanwhile the Sieur continued on his
way, always following the coast, until he came to
Cape de la Héve, near which place he consigned his
son, sieur de sainct Just, to the care of God; and,
veering around the cape, he sailed toward the river
of la Héve, which forms a port more than two leagues
wide and six leagues long, expecting to find there a
Chief, whom the French had for a long time called
Martin. But he had gone away, on account of the
deaths which had occurred there from some form of
dysentery. Afterwards, this Martin, having heard
that the Sieur had done him the honor of coming to
visit him, followed him up with thirty-five or forty
men, and near Cape Sable overtook him and thanked
him for this visit. The Sieur, who is a pleasant and
agreeable gentleman, received him kindly; although
some time before, in the year 1607, he had been
somewhat angry at him, because when he, (the Sieur),
with only a few men, was passing this same la Héve,
seeing himself surrounded by three canoes full of
Savages, he made them all get in line upon one side.
Thereupon, Martin having remarked that the Sieur
was afraid of them, the former was, in fact, in danger
of seeing that his conclusion was wrong. At this last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
meeting, Martin was treated with great kindness, and
<span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>b</sup> <em>Act of
piety.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span>
invited to become a Christian like Membertou and<sup>b</sup>
several others, and [15] to go to Port Royal to be
more fully instructed. He promised to do this and
to bring all his company. And, as the Savages never
go to visit their friends empty-handed, he went
hunting, that he might get some venison for this
occasion; <span class="snir"><span class="hidev">|</span><sup>c</sup>
<em>Peril.</em><span class="hidev">|</span></span> meanwhile the Sieur went on ahead,
in order to meet them there (i.e. at Port Royal).
But near Cape Fourchu,<sup>c</sup> behold him carried by a
land breeze straight out to sea, and so far, that he
was six days without food (except some birds caught
upon an island, which he still had), and without other
fresh water than what he could sometimes catch in
the sails; in short, seeing nothing but sky and water;
and if he had not had a small compass, he would
have been in danger of being carried to the coast of
Florida by the violence of the winds, the tempests,
and the waves. At last, owing to his good judgment
and energy, he was able to land near the island of
sainte Croix, where Oagimont, Captain of the place,
brought him some sea-biscuits, for which he had
traded with the French people. And thence, being
familiar with the place, he crossed French bay, about
twenty leagues wide here, and reached Port Royal,
five weeks after his departure. Here he found his
people wondering greatly at his long absence, and already
meditating a change, which could not have been
otherwise than disastrous. It is thus, at the peril of
his life, and with incredible hardships and sufferings,
he goes out to seek the lost sheep, to lead them
back into the fold of Jesus Christ, and to add to the
heavenly Kingdom. And if these people are not
converted by the thousand, it must be remembered
[16] that no Prince or Lord has, up to the present,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
given any assistance to sieur de Poutrincourt; the
avaricious are even stealing from him the wealth of
his province, and he permits this in his goodness, in
order to do nothing that will exasperate the nobles
over here; although, as the King has given him the
land, he would be justified in refusing to others the
fruits thereof, as well as entry into his ports, and the
cutting down of his forests. When he has more
ample means, he can send men into the more populous
districts, where they must go in strength, and
reap a great harvest for the extension of the Church.
But we must first establish the State, without which
the Church cannot exist. And for this reason the
first help should be given to this State, and not to
what has the pretext of piety. For, when the State
is founded, it will be its duty to provide for that
which is spiritual. Let us return to Port Royal.
When the Sieur arrived there he found Martin and
his friends, baptized, and all strongly imbued with
zeal for the Christian Religion, listening very devoutly
to divine service, which was usually sung to Music
composed by the Sieur.</p>

the Patriarch Fleuches, to be instructed and baptized.</p>

<p>This year the country has been visited, here and
there, by dysenteric troubles, which have been fatal

was stricken a week after his baptism with the disease,
and died thereof. But [18] it is worthy of being
remembered that this dying man always had the
sacred name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> upon his lips. In his last moments
he requested that when he died he should be
buried with the Christians. There was some trouble
about this. For the Savages having still some reverence
for the burial places of their fathers and friends,
wished to take him to Cape Sable, forty leagues distant
from the Port. On the other hand, the Sieur
wished to have him buried according to his request.
Thereupon a dispute arose, and the Savages, seizing
their bows and arrows, wanted to take away the

corpse. But the Sieur placed a dozen arquebusiers
under arms, who carried it off without resistance,
after he had demonstrated to them that this had been
the intention of the deceased, and that, being a Christian,
he must be buried with his fellow-Christians;
and so he was, with the usual prayers of the Church.
When this was done, they were all given some bread,

<p>But as we are now on the subject of sickness and
death, I do not wish to pass over in silence a custom
which I did not know about, and which, never having
seen practiced, I did not speak of in my History
of New France. It is, that when our Savages see a
person gradually failing from old age or sickness,
through a certain compassion they hasten his death;
showing him that he must die to procure rest, that
it is a wretched thing to languish from day to day,
that he is only a burden to them, and offer other
similar arguments, by means of which they make the
sick man resolve to [19] die. And then they take
away from him all food, give him his beautiful robe
of Beaver or other fur, and place him in a half-reclining
posture upon his bed, singing to him praises of
his past life, and of his fortitude in death; to this he
agrees, and replies with his last chant, like the Swan;
When it is finished, all leave him, and he considers
himself happy to die rather than to linger on. For
these people, being nomadic, and not being able to
continue living in one place, cannot drag after them
their fathers or friends, the aged, or the sick. That
is why they treat them in this manner. If they are
sick, they first make incisions into their stomachs,
from which the Pilotois,<a name="endanchor_23._23" id="endanchor_23._23"></a><a href="#endnote_23._23" class="endanchor">23</a>
or sorcerers, suck the blood.
And, whatever the cause, if they see a man can no
longer drag himself along, they put him in the condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
above described, and throw upon his navel so much
cold water, that Nature weakens little by little, and
thus he dies with great steadfastness and fortitude.</p>

Membertou au fond du Port Royal à quatre lieuës loin

Ledit Sieur le console, &amp; le fait enlever de la pour le

<p>This is the way they had treated Henry Membertou

Port Royal, four leagues away from his fort; to him
the said Membertou related his story, saying he did
not care to die yet. The Sieur consoled him, and
had him lifted up and taken away with him. Then,
when they arrived at the Fort, he had a good fire
prepared for him, and, placing him near it upon a
good bed, had him rubbed, [20] nursed, well cared
for, and doctored; and the result was, at the end of
three days, behold Membertou up and about, ready

<p>You cannot all at once eradicate the deep-rooted
customs and habits of any people, whoever they may

several centuries after them; witness the ceremonies
of the candles on Candlemas, the Processions of the
Rogation-days, the Bonfires of saint John the Baptist's
day, the holy Water, and many other traditions
that we have in the Church, which have been introduced
for a laudable purpose, to convert to a good
usage what had only been abused. So, although
Membertou's family were Christians, nevertheless
they had not yet been taught that it is not lawful for
men to shorten the days of the aged, or sick, although
they think they are doing right; but rather that they
must await the will of God, and leave Nature to do
her work. And certainly a Pastor is excusable who
fails to do things of which he has no knowledge.</p>

Something similar was done in Martin's sickness.
For they threw water upon him in this way, in order
not to see him linger along; during his sickness,
when the Patriarch and a man named de Montfort
had caught for him, and made him eat some wild
pigeon, which he liked very much, he asked them,
as they were speaking to him about Heaven, if there
would be any wild pigeon there. To which they
answered that there was something better there, and
that he would be happy. Such is the simplicity of a
people [21] more fit to possess the kingdom of heaven
than those who know a great deal, and whose
deeds are evil. For they believe and carefully observe
what is proposed to them, even reproaching
our people for their carelessness, if they do not pray
to God before and after eating; this was done a
number of times by Henry Membertou, who likes to
attend divine service, and always wears the sign of
the Cross upon his bosom. Furthermore, not being
able to formulate suitable prayers to God, he begged
the Pastor to remember him, and all his brother Savages
who have been baptized. Since the last baptism,
of which we have spoken, there were several
others, on the 14th and 16th of August, the 8th and
9th of October, and the 1st of December, 1610. And
altogether the Pastor calculates that he has baptized
one hundred and forty in one year, to whom have
been given the names of many distinguished people
over here, according to the inclinations of those who
held the position of godfathers or godmothers:
these have given godsons to the following.</p>

like Abel, who (as Philo says) offered his sacrifice to
God in the morning; which Cain did not do. And
sages observe, by citing Jacob, who received Isaac's
first blessing, which was stronger than that given to
Esau, that those who pray in the morning and receive
the first benediction of God, always have a greater

has never spared himself in the performance of his

Savages, in answer to their requests, saying they
wanted to be like Membertou, namely, Christians.
Also sometimes he has led his band in a procession
to a mountain North of their settlement, upon which
there is a square rock [26] as high as a table, covered
with thick moss, where I have sometimes enjoyed a
pleasant rest. I have called this place mount de la

<p>[27] Nos gens outre le labourage &amp; iardinage,
avoient l'exercice de la chasse, de la pécherie, &amp; de
leurs fortifications. Ils ne manquerent aussi d'exercice
à remettre &amp; couvrir les batimens &amp; le moulin delaissez
depuis nótre retour en l'an 1607. Et d'autant
que la fonteine estoit vn peu eloignée du Fort, ils
firent vn pui dans icelui Fort, de l'eau duquel ils se
sont fort bien trouvez. De sorte que (chose emerueillable)
ils n'ont eu aucunes maladies, quoy qu'il y
ait eu beaucoup de sujet d'en avoir par la necessité
qu'ils ont soufferte. Car le Sieur de Sainct Iust fils
dudit Sieur de Poutrincourt ayant eu mandement de
retourner dans quatre mois (comme nous avons dit
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
ci-dessus) on l'attendoit dans la fin de Nouembre pour
avoir du rafraichissement, &amp; toutesfois il n'arriva que
le iour de Pentecoste, qui fut le 22. de May ensuivant.
Cela fut cause qu'il fallut retrencher les vivres qu'ils
avoient en assez petite quantité. De manger toujours
du poisson (s'il n'est bõ &amp; ferme) ou des coquillages
seuls sans pain, cela est dangereux, &amp; cause la dysenterie,
cõme nous avõs rapporté ci-dessus de quelques
Sauuages qui en sont morts, &amp; pouvons en avoir autre
témoignage par les gens du Sieur de Monts, qui moururent
en nombre de vingt la premiere année qu'ils
hivernerent à Kebec, tãt pour la nouveauté de la demeure,
que pour avoir trop mangé d'anguilles &amp;
autres poissõs. La chasse aussi ne se trouve pas à foison
en vn lieu où il faut viure de cela, &amp; où l'on fait
vne demeure arrestée. C'est ce qui rend les [28] Sauvages
vagabons, &amp; fait qu'ilz ne peuvent vivre en vne
place. Quand ils ont esté six semaines en vn lieu il
faut changer de demeure. Ilz prindrent au terroir du
Port Royal six Grignaces ou Ellans, cet hiver, dont
ils en apportoient vn quartier ou moitié aux nótres.
Mais cela ne va gueres loin à tant de gens. Le iour
de Pasques fleuries le fils ainé de Membertou dit
Louïs, en poursuivoit vn, qui s'estant venu rendre au
Port Royal passoit l'eau, quand la femme dudit Louïs
vint faire vne alarme en criant plusieurs fois, <em>Ech'pada,
Ech'pada</em>, c'est à dire, Aux épées, Aux épées. On
pensoit que ce fussent quelques ennemis, mais il fut
le bien venu. Le Sieur de Poutrincourt se mit dans
vne chaloupe pour aller au devant, &amp; avec vn dogue
il le fit tourner en arrière d'où il venoit. Il y avoit
du plaisir à le cotoyer si proche de sa ruine. Si-tost
qu'il approcha de terre, ledit Louïs le transperça
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
d'une fleche, le Sieur de Iouy luy tira vne arquebusade
à la téte, mais <em>Actaudinech'</em> dit Paul fils puisné de
Membertou lui coupa dextrement vne veine au col,
qui l'atterra du tout. Ceci donna vne curée &amp; consolation
stomachale aux nótres. Mais cela ne dura pas
toujours. Il fallut revenir à l'ordinaire. Et faut
penser qu'en ce retranchement de vivres dont nous
avons parlé il y eut de grandes affaires pour le chef,
car des mutineries &amp; conspirations survindrent, &amp; d'vn
costé le cuisinier déroboit vne partie de la portion des
autres, &amp; tel crioit à la faim, qui avoit abondance de
pain &amp; de chair dans sa [29] cellule, ainsi que s'est veu
par experience. Ceux qui portoient le blé au moulin,
de quinze boisseaux n'en rendoient que douze de farine
au lieu de dix-huict. Et de la necessité d'autrui ils
troquoient avarement des Castors auec les Sauvages.
Neantmoins (par trop de bonté) tant de fautes leur
furent pardonnées apres visitation faite. Pauvres sots
qui font des conseils si legers, &amp; ne voyent point ce
qu'ils deviendront par apres, &amp; que leur vie ne peut
estre asseurée que par vn perpetuel exil de leur patrie,
&amp; de tout ce qu'ils ont de plus cher au monde.</p>
</div>
<div class="translation">

<p>[27] Our people, besides the farm and garden work,
passed their time in hunting, fishing, and in making
fortifications. Work was not wanting also in repairing
and roofing the buildings and the mill, abandoned
since our return in 1607. And, as the spring
was some little distance from there, they dug a well
in the Fort, and found the water very good. So that
(wonderful to relate) they had no sickness, although
there was sufficient cause for it in the privations they
suffered. For Sieur de Sainct Just, son of Sieur de
Poutrincourt, having been ordered to return in four
months (as we have said above), was expected the
last of November, with fresh supplies; yet he did
not come until the day of Pentecost, the 22nd of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
following May. For this reason they were obliged
to diminish their rations, of which they had rather a
small quantity. To always eat fish (unless it is good
and firm) or shellfish alone, without bread, is dangerous,
and causes dysentery, as we have observed
above in regard to certain Savages who died of it.
We can prove this also by Sieur de Monts' men, who
died, to the number of twenty, the first year they
wintered at Kebec, both on account of their change
of dwelling, and because they ate too many eels and
other fish. Furthermore, game is not always to be
found in abundance in a place where people are
obliged to live on it, and where there is a permanent
settlement. This is what makes [28] nomads of the
Savages, and prevents them from remaining long in
one place. When they have been six weeks in a
place, they are obliged to leave their habitation.
This winter, in the neighborhood of Port Royal they
took six Grignaces<a name="endanchor_34._34" id="endanchor_34._34"></a><a href="#endnote_34._34" class="endanchor">34</a>
or Elks, and brought a quarter or
half of them to our people. But that did not go far
with so many men. On Palm Sunday, Louis, the
eldest son of Membertou, was on the trail of one
which had reached Port Royal and was just crossing
the river, when his wife caused an alarm by crying
out several times, <em>Ech'pada, Ech'pada</em>, that is, "To
arms, to arms." They thought it might be an enemy,
but it was a welcome one. Sieur de Poutrincourt
got into a boat to go and head it off, and, with the
help of a big dog, made it turn back whence it came.
There was some sport in chasing it so near its death.
As soon as it approached the land, Louis pierced it
through with an arrow, Sieur de Jouy discharged his
arquebuse at its head, but <em>Actaudinech'</em>, or Paul, the
younger son of Membertou, dexterously cut a vein in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
its neck, which completely finished it. This gave
our people some game, and consolation to their stomachs.
But it did not last always, and they had to
come back to ordinary fare. You must bear in mind
that, in this cutting down of supplies, of which we
have spoken, there were great responsibilities for the
commandant; for mutinies and conspiracies arose;
and on the one hand the cook stole a part of what
belonged to the others, while a certain one cried
"hunger" who had plenty of bread and meat in his
[29] cell, as has been proven. Those who carried
wheat to the mill, from fifteen bushels brought back
only twelve of flour, instead of eighteen. They also
took advantage of the necessity of others, in miserly
traffic in Beaver skins with the Savages. Nevertheless
(through too much kindness), all these faults
were pardoned after they had been looked into.
Poor fools, who take good counsel so lightly, and do
not see what will become of them afterwards, and
that their lives can only be assured by a perpetual
exile from their country, and from all they hold dearest
in the world.</p>

chasse. Quand le Haren fut venu, les Sauvages (selon

<p>When the winter was over and the mildness of the
weather allured the fish to seek fresh water, upon
the 14th of April, men were sent out fishing. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
are a great many streams at Port Royal, and among
them three or four where the fish swarm in the
spawning season. One contains vast numbers of
Smelts<a name="endanchor_36._36" id="endanchor_36._36"></a><a href="#endnote_36._36" class="endanchor">36</a>
in April. Another, Herring, another, Sturgeon
and Salmon, etc. So some were then sent to
the river at the [30] back of Port Royal, to see if the
Smelts had come. When they reached the place,
Membertou (who was encamped there), received
them hospitably, regaling them with meat and fish.
Thence they went to the stream called Liesse<a name="endanchor_37._37" id="endanchor_37._37"></a><a href="#endnote_37._37" class="endanchor">37</a> by
Sieur des Noyers, an Advocate in Parliament, where
they found so many fish that they had to send and
get some salt, to lay in a store of them. These fish
are very tempting and delicate, and are not so injurious
as shellfish are apt to be. They remain about
six weeks in this stream; after that there is another
small river near Port Royal, where Herring is found,
also another to which Sardines come in great abundance.
But as to the river of the Port, which is the
river Equille, since named the Dauphin,<a name="endanchor_38._38" id="endanchor_38._38"></a><a href="#endnote_38._38" class="endanchor">38</a>
at the time
of which we speak it furnished Sturgeon and Salmon
to any one who would take the trouble to fish for
them. When the Herrings came, the Savages (with
their usual good-nature) let the French know it by
signaling from their quarters with fires and smoke.
The hint was not neglected, for this kind of hunting
is much more sure than that of the woods.</p>

n'eust fait que trop volontiers: C'est d'envoyer quelque
present de vivres &amp; d'habits à ces Neophytes &amp;
nouveaux Chrétiens qui portẽt les noms du feu Roy,
de la Royne Regente, &amp; de Messeigneurs &amp; Dames
les enfans de France. Mais chacun regarde à son

cela. Ce qu'il ne peut toutefois obtenir. Et voyant
que cette affaire tiroit en longueur, &amp; qu'il falloit aller

<h4>RETURN TO NEW FRANCE.</h4>

<p>It was the 10th of May, when the last bread was
baked, that they took counsel about returning to
France, if help did not come within a month. This
they were ready to do. But on the day of Pentecost
[May 22nd] [31] God sent his consoling spirit to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
company, already so disheartened, and it came to
them very opportunely in the arrival of Sieur de
Sainct Just, of whom we must say a few words; for
awhile ago we left him at the port of Dieppe, and
have not seen what he has been doing since. When
he was presented to the Queen, she was wonderfully
pleased to hear about the conversion of several Savages,
who had been baptized before the departure of
sieur de Sainct Just, an account of which I published
and presented to her Majesty. Thereupon the Jesuits
offered themselves to aid in the work. The Queen
favored the plan, and recommended them. I should
have been glad, if, before their departure, some one
had suggested to her Majesty a thing which she
would willingly have done; namely, to send some
presents of food and clothes to these Neophytes and
new Christians, who bear the names of the deceased
King, of the Queen Regent, and of my Lords and
Ladies, the children of France.<a name="endanchor_39._39" id="endanchor_39._39"></a><a href="#endnote_39._39" class="endanchor">39</a>
But every one looks
out for his own interests. Sieur de Sainct Just, after
his report had been made, meant to obtain protection
for the Beaver trade, believing that considerations of
a religious nature would easily secure this for him.
However, he could not obtain it. And seeing that
the affair was dragging on, and that he must go and
relieve his father, having been ordered to so arrange
affairs as to be back in four months, he took leave of
the Queen, who sent with him two Jesuits for the
conversion of the Savage tribes over there. But as
sieur de Poutrincourt had taken an [32] able man at
his departure, it seems to me that these men (who
can be more useful here) were in too much of a hurry
for the best interests of the Sieur; because the delay,
which took place on their account, was very detrimental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
to him, and caused a dissolution of his partnership.
In such undertakings the State must first
be founded, without which the Church cannot exist,
as I have said before. I expressed my opinion on
this subject to sieur de Sainct Just, to the effect that
it was necessary to guarantee a living before anything
else, to obtain a crop of wheat, to have cattle
and domestic fowls, before they could bring these
people together. Now this blind haste came very
near, besides the above-mentioned losses, reducing
the company that was over there to misery and want,
as they had nothing left but the one baking of bread,
already made and distributed.</p>

<p>Sieur de Poutrincourt had gone into partnership
with two Dieppe merchants,<a name="endanchor_40._40" id="endanchor_40._40"></a><a href="#endnote_40._40" class="endanchor">40</a>
who, seeing the two Jesuits,&mdash;namely,
Father Biar[d], a very learned man, a
native of Gascony, of whom Monsieur the first President
of Bordeaux has given me a high opinion; and
Father Nemon [Ennemond],&mdash;ready to embark, they
objected, and did not want them to go upon the voyage,
saying that they would willingly provide for all
other kinds of men, Capuchins, Minimes, Cordeliers,
Recollets, etc.;<a name="endanchor_41._41" id="endanchor_41._41"></a><a href="#endnote_41._41" class="endanchor">41</a>
but, as to these, they did not want
them at all, and could not consider themselves safe
in their company; that if the Queen wished them
to go there, let their [the merchants'] money be refunded,
and they might do whatever they wished.
Now there is a delay. [33] The Court must be written
to, her Majesty must be informed of the situation,
the money to reimburse the Merchants must be
collected, and journeys must be made: meanwhile,
the season is passing away. The Queen granted
them two thousand écus, in addition to which collections
were made from the families of Princes, Nobles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and people devoted to the cause, whence they obtained
a great deal of money. In short, they reimbursed
each of the Merchants two thousand livres,
and at last set sail, the 26th of January, 1611. The
weather was disagreeable, this being the roughest
part of the winter. They were some time upon the
sea, thinking they would be able to resist the winds,
but they were compelled to put into port in England,
where they remained until the 16th of February.
And the 19th of April they were upon the great Codfish
Banks, where they found some Ships from Dieppe
and Sainct Malo. The 29th, being between these
Banks and the island of Sable, they sailed before the
wind a distance of twelve leagues, in the midst of
ice, mountain high, upon which they disembarked to
get some fresh water, which they found good. In
emerging from this ice, they met one of Sieur de
Monts' ships, commanded by Captain Champlein,<a name="endanchor_42._42" id="endanchor_42._42"></a><a href="#endnote_42._42" class="endanchor">42</a>
whose return we are awaiting to learn of some new
discoveries. Afterwards, they continued to encounter
other masses of ice, for a distance of fifty leagues,
which they had much difficulty in outsailing. The
fifth of May, they sighted the land and port of Campseau,
the location of which can be seen in the great
geographical Chart in my History.<a name="endanchor_43._43" id="endanchor_43._43"></a><a href="#endnote_43._43" class="endanchor">43</a>

more than six thousand escus [écus] worth of peltries

what they needed. A wicked act was also committed
before the ship's departure from Dieppe, by
the Overseer of the boat, who, being charged to load

<h4>EFFECTS OF GOD'S GRACE IN NEW
FRANCE.</h4>

<p>What I have just related may be attributed to the
grace of God; as also the roots that were sent them
in their need, which we have already mentioned;
and furthermore, the exercise given the lazy ones
who would not take part in tilling the soil, and who,
without intending it, prepared for cultivation a fine
field, while seeking for these roots. But more particularly
the exemption from sickness; which is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
very evident miracle. For, as to former sojourns, not
one has been passed without some deaths, although
they were well provided for. And in this one not
only the healthy remained well, but also those who
were afflicted with ill-health in France have there
recovered. A witness of this is a worthy man named
Bertrand,<a name="endanchor_29a._29a" id="endanchor_29a._29a"></a><a href="#endnote_29._29" class="endanchor">29</a>
who, at Paris, was daily tormented with
the gout, from which he was entirely free over there.
But, since he came back here, the same trouble has
returned with more severity than ever, although he
takes care not to indulge in excesses.</p>

de ce qu'il avoit autrefois oui dire à noz gẽs que Dieu
qui nourrit les oiseaux du ciel, &amp; les bétes de la terre,
ne delaisse iamais ceux qui ont esperance en lui, selon
la parolle de nôtre Sauveur.</p>
</div>
<div class="translation">

<p>Towards the end of Spring, when Membertou's
children had gone hunting, where they remained a
long time, it happened that Membertou was sorely
pressed for food; and in this time of need [38] he remembered
that he had formerly heard our people say
that God, who feeds the birds of the air and the
beasts of the fields, never abandons those who have
hope in him, according to the words of our Savior.</p>

<p>En cette necessité donc il se met à prier Dieu, ayant
enuoyé sa fille voir au ruisseau du moulin s'il y auroit

esté gueres long temps en prieres que voici sadite fille
arriver criant à haute voix, <em>Nouchich', Beggin pech'kmok,
Beggin ëta pech'kmok</em>: c'est à dire: Père, le haren
est venu; le haren certes est venu. Et vit par
effect le soin que Dieu a des siens, à son contentement.

<p>So, in this necessity, he began to pray to God, after
having sent his daughter to see if there were any
signs of fish in the mill-creek. He had not been a
long time in prayer, when lo, his daughter comes
running back crying in a loud voice, <em>Nouchich', Beggin
pech'kmok, Beggin ëta pech'kmok</em>; that is, "Father,
the herring have come; the herring have come indeed."
And he saw effectually, and to his satisfaction,
God's care over his own. He (or some of his
family) also had proof of this upon another occasion,
in a like time of need, when he encountered an Elk,
and another time a stranded Whale.</p>

whither his [39] desires more than ever attract him,

these I have observed are almost all desirous
of risking their fortunes there, if God would open
up the way for them to do something. To this the
great do not care to lend their ears, and the small
have not wings strong enough to fly so far. Nevertheless
there is something strange and incredible in
the perseverance of both Sieur de Monts and Sieur
de Poutrincourt; the former having continued to send
expeditions over there for ten years; and the latter,
in spite of the difficulties enumerated above, having
recently sent over another one, awaiting here the return
of spring, to go again to see his people. May
God grant to both the means of doing something
which may succeed to the glory of his name, and to

[562] The Mission in New France, or Canada.</h3>

<p class="dropcap">NEW FRANCE, an immense region adjoining
Brazil and Peru on the North, and opposite
the coast of Aquitaine in a westerly direction,
is situated between the same parallels of
latitude as [563] is our France; and is separated from
it by the very moderate voyage of 800 leagues, or,
where the ocean is broadest, of 1,000 leagues.
Because it is thus opposite and near to our France,
our ancestors called it New France; and for this
nomenclature another especially appropriate reason
occurred in the good fortune by which our French
fellow-countrymen were the first to take possession
of this hitherto unknown region, and visited it in
frequent voyages more than a hundred years ago.
But the name of Canada, which is commonly given to
this entire country, belongs only to that Northern region
which is washed by the abundant waters of the
river <span class="smcap">Canada</span>,<a name="endanchor_48._48" id="endanchor_48._48"></a><a href="#endnote_48._48" class="endanchor">48</a>
and of the noble gulf which is called
St. Lawrence. Indeed, the whole territory of New
France, although now much more confined than formerly,
towards the frontiers of Florida, is nevertheless
bounded on the South by the thirty-ninth parallel,
and extends many leagues beyond the breadth of our
France. Moreover, it stretches with yet unknown
limits towards the North, and in vast expanses to the
Chinese sea on the West; finally it is bounded Eastward
by our Aquitanian and Breton Ocean, lying opposite
and between the same parallels.</p>

<span class="smcap">There</span> ought to be in that region the same sort of
Climate in every respect as that of our France, from
the fact, as we pointed out, of its similar situation, and
this is actually the case. Moreover, there is no reason
why the soil should not be equally fertile, if the cultivation
of the plains were long continued upon the uplands,
and if it were not for the dense shades of the almost
unbroken forests. [564] For the subsoil of the
whole country is very rich, as trees of immense size and
height readily demonstrate. That the surface-soil is
also endued with great fertility is shown by the pleasing
luxuriance of the vegetation over all the plains.</p>

and dull in those pursuits which depend
upon talent or memory. On the whole, the race consists
of men who are hardly above the beasts. One
tribe hardly ever has intercourse with another, either
distant or near, except such as may arise in the prosecution
of offensive or defensive warfare. Even the
members of the same tribe, united by a common location
and the vicinity of their dwellings, are seldom
accustomed to meet together, except to take measures
concerning war against a common enemy. Of foreign
nations, the French are almost the only people
whom they admit to their harbors, for the sake of disposing
of their Beaver skins and other peltries, in
exchange for necessary clothing and utensils.</p>

sent out at intervals, continue to this day

<p><span class="smcap">New</span> France presents to the French, as they approach
it, two coasts, one which borders with a narrow
frontage upon our Ocean to the East; and another
far longer, which extends Southward to the confines
of Florida. The former side abounds in bays and
estuaries, by which one may readily penetrate into
the interior; by these routes the French usually enter
these regions; but, since the other coast, lying opposite
our France, is rendered almost inaccessible by
the intervention of a great island which they call
Newfoundland, our people do not approach in that
direction. The immense plain in that quarter is
watered by a river of vast size and mighty volume,
its course directly eastward from almost the farthest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
west, until, by reason of the narrow strait at the island
of Newfoundland [566] and the opposition of the
island itself, its mouth is broadly curved towards the
Southern coast. The native name of that river is
<em>Sacqué</em>;<a name="endanchor_50._50" id="endanchor_50._50"></a><a href="#endnote_50._50" class="endanchor">50</a>
the French have called it St. Lawrence;
its source the natives seek more than 500 leagues
distant, in a lake 300 leagues in width. Into this
main stream other noble rivers flow from the North,
such as the Saguenay,<a name="endanchor_51._51" id="endanchor_51._51"></a><a href="#endnote_51._51" class="endanchor">51</a>
the Three Rivers,<a name="endanchor_52._52" id="endanchor_52._52"></a><a href="#endnote_52._52" class="endanchor">52</a>&mdash;or
three rivers flowing together,&mdash;the Algomequi,<a name="endanchor_53._53" id="endanchor_53._53"></a><a href="#endnote_53._53" class="endanchor">53</a>
and many others. These rivers are open for navigation
far Northward&mdash;the Saguenay five hundred
leagues, the Three Rivers four hundred leagues,
From the mountains<a name="endanchor_54._54" id="endanchor_54._54"></a><a href="#endnote_54._54" class="endanchor">54</a>
upon the Southern bank of the
Sacqué River other notable streams flow across to the
Southern coast of the Ocean, and from these the native
names for most of the tribes and districts of that
region are derived; but upon some of them the
French afterward conferred names after their own
fashion. The rivers flowing Southward are the St.
John, Pentegoët, Quinibequi, Choüacoet,<a name="endanchor_11a._11a" id="endanchor_11a._11a"></a><a href="#endnote_11._11" class="endanchor">11</a> and Norembega,
which last stream Champlain<a name="endanchor_55._55" id="endanchor_55._55"></a><a href="#endnote_55._55" class="endanchor">55</a> asserts to
be the same as the Pentegoët. The tribes across the
Sacqué or St. Lawrence, towards the North, not far
from its mouth, are the Canadis<a name="endanchor_56._56" id="endanchor_56._56"></a><a href="#endnote_56._56" class="endanchor">56</a>
and Excomminquis;<a name="endanchor_10a._10a" id="endanchor_10a._10a"></a><a href="#endnote_10._10" class="endanchor">10</a>
but at a distance from these, on the same Northern
shore, toward the west, in the direction of Florida,
dwell the Algomeguis<a name="endanchor_57._57" id="endanchor_57._57"></a><a href="#endnote_57._57" class="endanchor">57</a>
and the Ochasteguis.<a name="endanchor_58._58" id="endanchor_58._58"></a><a href="#endnote_58._58" class="endanchor">58</a> Across

the Montagnais; beyond the Pentegoëts; directly
toward the Quinibequi River, the Eteminquis;
then the Almochiquois, at the Choüacoet River,
scattered over a very extensive region; finally, between
Florida and the great Sacqué River, the Iroquois
inhabit enormous tracts of both level and mountainous
country. Many of the remaining tribes of
New France, especially those of the North, across
the great Sacqué River, our French countrymen
know only from hearsay. Among those whom they
know, however, they have secured as friends, and almost
as allies, the Souriquois, Eteminquis, Montagnais,
Almochiquois, Algomequois, and Ochasteguis.
The Iroquois, who are deadly enemies of these tribes,
prove hostile to the French also, mainly because the
latter have waged war against them, in company
with their enemies. Certain of these tribes&mdash;the
Almochiquois, Iroquois, and Ochasteguis&mdash;practice
agriculture, though unskillfully, and plant Indian
corn and the Brazilian bean.<a name="endanchor_61._61" id="endanchor_61._61"></a><a href="#endnote_61._61" class="endanchor">61</a></p>

<p>Moreover, in this great extent of territory, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
means of numerous expeditions and in more than a
century, the French have established only five settlements;<a name="endanchor_65._65" id="endanchor_65._65"></a><a href="#endnote_65._65" class="endanchor">65</a>
the first of these was founded by Jacques
Quartier during his last voyage, not at the inaccessible
narrows and rocks of the place now called <em>Saincte
Croix</em>,<a name="endanchor_66._66" id="endanchor_66._66"></a><a href="#endnote_66._66" class="endanchor">66</a>
but in almost the very spot where now stands
Quebec, fifteen leagues on this side of Ste. Croix. Another
was built by Pierre du Gas, sieur de Monts, in
the year 1604, upon a small island, among the Eteminquis,
close to their Southern shore, to which settlement
and island he gave the name of <em>Saincte Croix</em>.
He also in the same year, upon a sort of peninsula
on the Acadian coast, near Port Royal, erected
a small fort of the same name, defended by a
ditch and a rampart. Port Royal, and the fort of
the same name as the harbor, are on what is called
French <em>Bay</em>, one hundred and fifty leagues from
Cape Campseau, eight leagues from the sea. A
<em>bay</em> among the French, as among the Spanish,
is a large indentation in the land at the shore
of the sea or of a great river, angular or round
in shape, giving the waters entrance to the interior
regions. At the head of French Bay is a harbor,
reached by a channel three-quarters of a mile long;
it is two leagues long and one wide, capable of receiving
2,000 large ships, and because of its majestic
appearance was named <em>Port Royal</em> by the Frenchman
Champlain. A third settlement was founded by sieur
de [569] Monts, four years later, at the point of Quebec,
on the Southern bank of the Sacqué river, near
the isle of Orleans,<a name="endanchor_67._67" id="endanchor_67._67"></a><a href="#endnote_67._67" class="endanchor">67</a>
in the territory of the Montagnais;
Champlain, who was in charge of the work,
called this fort Quebec, from the name of the district,<a name="endanchor_41a._41a" id="endanchor_41a._41a"></a><a href="#endnote_41._41" class="endanchor">41</a>
and observed that in almost the same place
Jacques Quartier's post of Ste. Croix had in former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
days been built. Our Fathers were laying the foundations
of the fifth and last French settlement at the
mouth of the Pentegoët river, when they were prevented
from prosecuting the work by a descent of the
English, and carried off into captivity, contrary to
justice and the law of nations. These details,
which otherwise would have delayed the orderly narrative
of events, having been thus first explained, let
us devote our pen to the Canadian expedition undertaken

<p>Potrincourt had asked of Henry IV. the fort at
Port Royal, because it had been granted as a gift to
him by sieur de Monts at the very time of its establishment,
which was perhaps the best reason he could
give for advancing and maintaining his pretensions,
and had obtained not merely a claim upon it, but its
possession. Following the grant of this fort, and also
the government of a definite territory in New France,
to Potrincourt, the King informed Father Coton<a name="endanchor_68._68" id="endanchor_68._68"></a><a href="#endnote_68._68" class="endanchor">68</a> that
he wished to employ the services of our Brethren in
bringing the Savages to Christ. He also desired him
to write to the General of the Society, in his own
name, in order that Fathers might be selected for
this undertaking, whom the King himself would take
measures to send thither at the first available opportunity,
while an annuity of 2,000 livres was to be allowed
the Mission. It was during the eighth year of
this century when the King made this decision in regard
to Canadian affairs; but, in spite of his plans, by
reason of more weighty business which called his attention
elsewhere, [570] and also the hindrance caused
by his death, but especially because of the negligence
of those who were managing the Canadian province
for the Crown, the departure of our brethren was
delayed until the third year thereafter. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
either by some accident, or by the purpose of men,
it came to be delayed the entire space of three years,
although our brethren were already equipped. Such
difficulties, also, suddenly arose as plainly showed that
our plans for this voyage were displeasing to the Evil
Spirit. The Queen had paid over 500 golden crowns,
according to the decree of the late King; Mesdames
<em>de Vernueil</em>, <em>de Sourdis</em>, and <em>de Guercheville</em> had given
generous contributions,&mdash;one, the sacred furniture
of the altar; another, an abundance of linen vestments;
the third, a very liberal allowance of money
for the expenses of the voyage. Father Pierre Biard
and Father Enemund Massé had been selected for
the undertaking, and had prepared themselves with
great courage, eagerly awaiting their departure. The
day for sailing had been agreed upon by them
with Biencourt, the son of Potrincourt, and Thomas
Robin, the leaders of the expedition, for the 24th
day of October, 1610; but, when they arrived upon
that day, the ship was undergoing repairs, and
that, too, in a negligent manner, upon the land; so
far was it from being provided with suitable equipment
either for navigation or for the Canadian colony.
Two Calvinists had devoted their services and
resources to the repair of the ship, and, because Biencourt
and Robin lacked means to pay for the work,
the Calvinist merchants had contracted for a specified
portion of the profits of the voyage. By this right, as
masters in the ship, they thought themselves able to
declare, in the presence of the Jesuits, that there would
be no place for them in the vessel; [571] and they
emphatically asserted that, if it should be otherwise,
they would straightway forsake the prosecution of the
work, and all other business in their contract. From
this resolution, not even the authority of the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
herself, pronounced with dignity and severity by
Sieur <em>de Cicoigne</em>, the royal Governor of the city of
Dieppe, could move these servants of Calvin. The
matter was apparently in a desperate condition, because
only this one ship was that year being fitted
out for New France, and the two Calvinists would
not permit themselves to be moved in any respect.
This difficulty of ours deeply pained Madame
de Guercheville, a woman of extreme piety and
great spirit; but her ingenuity speedily devised a
method by which she might place us on the ship,
not as passengers, but as partners, to the exclusion of
the churlish Heretics. She therefore collected in a
few days, from the leading men and women of the
Court, 4,000 livres, as much as was necessary for fitting
out the ship; and by raising that sum deprived
the two Calvinists of a share in the vessel, establishing
at the same time a sufficient capital from which
there might each year be paid to the director of the
Canadian undertaking an allowance for our Mission.
When, therefore, by the diligence of this woman, the
obstacles which delayed us had been removed, although
nearly three months had been spent in equipping
the ship, still, in the eleventh year of this century,
on the 24th day of January, we set sail under
the leadership of God, from the shore at Dieppe;
and, after a voyage lasting in all four months, arrived
at Campseau harbor, on the Southern coast of
New France; at a distance thence of 120 leagues,
either by sea or land, we joyfully entered Port [572]
Royal. The exercises of the members of the Society
in piety, humility, and kindness toward all manner
of men, were especially observed by our brethren
during that sea-voyage, because an expedition of
great importance was being undertaken, and also for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the reason that, besides a few Calvinists, we were associated
with officers and seamen to whom it was absolutely
necessary that we should, on account of our
frequent intercourse, give more correct ideas concerning
the Institutum<a name="endanchor_69._69" id="endanchor_69._69"></a><a href="#endnote_69._69" class="endanchor">69</a>
of the Society than they had formerly
received. When we brought the ship to the coast
of this region, Champlain<a name="endanchor_70._70" id="endanchor_70._70"></a><a href="#endnote_70._70" class="endanchor">70</a>
met us,&mdash;a man renowned
not only for his valor in other respects, but also for
his voyages in this sea for seven years past; whom,
to our utter amazement, we have seen battling
against masses of ice, equal in size to great hills upon
land, with the greatest courage, and with remarkable
activity and skill, sailing forth bravely amid all these
dangers. Concerning the St. Lawrence, the greatest
river of Canada, this same Champlain writes, in his
commentaries upon his voyages, that its surface is
frozen to the depth of three entire yards, during
January and the two following months, to the
distance of a hundred leagues upward from its
mouth; and that the freezing of the water does not
extend farther, although no part of the river, since it
flows directly from west to east, is more Northerly
than another, or more protected by mountains, so as
to be warmer. He adds also that in the beginning
of April, by the melting of so great a mass of ice, the
broad mouth of the St. Lawrence is almost blocked
with frozen masses, which, he says, are carried forth a
long distance into the sea, and usually melt within
twelve days, each year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrival of our brethren at French Bay [573] and
Port Royal occurred on the 26th day of June, and
also,&mdash;certainly a most auspicious omen,&mdash;the sacred
feast of Pentecost. Nothing more opportune could
have happened to Potrincourt than the arrival of supplies,
if only these had been abundant, since his privations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
had compelled him to place a portion of the colony
to be supported among the Savages. Moreover, the
fact that we had not come well-furnished with provisions
was due, not only to the smallness of the ship,
which was of only sixty tons burden, but also to
the placing of more fishing tackle than provisions in
the cargo; then, finally, by thirty-six persons, the
number which was on board, there was a great
consumption of the ship's stores during four entire
months. Wherefore, Potrincourt, almost overwhelmed,
at the outset, by the necessity of maintaining
sixty men in this scarcity of provisions, was forced
to take early precautions lest the meagerly furnished
storehouse at Port Royal should be left bare for the
coming winter. As behooved the father of the colony,
he took upon himself the burden of managing
this business, and resolved that he himself would
cross over to France. With about forty of the people
at Port Royal, leaving his son Biencourt in command
of the fort there, and the rest of the company, he set
sail in the middle of July; and, in the latter part of
August, he reached the French coast.</p>

<div class="translation">
<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, the greatest desire of our brethren,
zealously occupied with the performance of their duties,
was at the start to know the language of the
natives, which the Frenchmen&mdash;caring but little for
it, with one exception&mdash;could not impart by rules, or
teach with advantage; so only one method remained,
to learn it from the stupid natives, not by lessons,
but by constant practice. Consequently, after our
associates had made various attempts to conciliate the
Savages, by gifts, by friendliness, and by [574] every
sort of service, they accomplished little or nothing.
For, besides the fact that they employed teachers not
at all fitted for instruction, from whom nothing could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
be obtained unless their stomachs were first liberally
crammed, and who, being very impatient of even a
short delay, would often be distracted and drawn
away from one by earnest inquiry about any subject:
the very nature of the language, also, so deficient in
words suitable for the expression of even the most
common ideas, evaded the eager pursuit of our men,
and greatly disheartened them. Of those things, indeed,
which fall under sight, touch, and the other
senses, the names were obtained from the answers of
the Savages in one way or another; but for those
things which elude the senses, there is the greatest
scarcity of names among that race, and also a profound
ignorance of the things themselves. The
knowledge of the latter class was despaired of, since
the Savages either could not, or would not explain the
former; one hope remained, in a young Frenchman,
fluent in the native tongue, of remarkable kindness
and affability, whom Father Biard also had laid
under obligations to himself by no ordinary favors.
This was Pontgravé, the son of Pontgravé,<a name="endanchor_71._71" id="endanchor_71._71"></a><a href="#endnote_71._71" class="endanchor">71</a>
an excellent
man, who in former years, together with
Champlain, represented Sieur de Monts in New
France; and this youth, who was preparing to pass
the winter no farther than eighteen leagues from
Port Royal, at the river St. John, our brethren were
anxious to meet, with his own ready consent, and
with inconvenience to no one, for the sake of the aid
of his instruction in acquiring the Canadian language.
Although Biencourt was consulted about this expedition,
and also requested by our comrades that they
might be allowed by his kind permission [575] to make
progress through Pontgravé in the foreign idiom, by
their ignorance of which, they were losing all the
fruits of their voyage to New France,<a name="endanchor_72._72" id="endanchor_72._72"></a><a href="#endnote_72._72" class="endanchor">72</a>
they did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
succeed; because such intercourse with Pontgravé inspired
suspicion in Biencourt. While our brethren
therefore patiently endured their troubles, until some
path more suitable to their plans should be revealed,
God placed within their reach the desired opportunity,
for doing a kindness to Henry Membertou,
a Sagamore who was dangerously ill, by caring
diligently for the salvation of both his soul and his
body. Among this people the chief of each tribe is
called a <span class="smcap">Sagamore</span>, and Membertou was Sagamore
among the Souriquois, in Acadia, to the St. John
river, North of the fort at Port Royal. However,
when he began to be afflicted with dysentery, he
was residing at <em>Bay Ste. Marie</em>, as they call it, between
Port Royal and the Southern coast, whence he
had ordered himself to be brought into the fort, in
order that he might profit by the care of our physicians.
Our fathers received him into their narrow
cabin, and, for many days, in the absence of his wife
and daughter, by day, and night, amid the noxious
filth of a vile disease, freely bestowed upon him their
services, as most assiduous and exceedingly solicitous
attendants. When he had been absolved upon Confession,
and anointed with the Holy oil, he arranged
with Biencourt about his burial, and said that he
wished to be interred in his own ancestral burial
place. Biencourt, who did not think the matter of
much importance, readily consented, and, upon hearing
the objections of Father Biard to his decision,
believed that trouble might be prevented if [576] that
grave would be blessed according to the Christian rite.
This opinion of Biencourt rendered Membertou so
much the more steadfast in his resolution; Father
Biard declared that he would not agree with them in
this, and explained why he would not consent. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
was no doubt that, if the Sagamore persisted in his
purpose, and Biencourt continued to support him,
some offense and disturbance would arise therefrom;
but Divine providence prevented this evil. The day
thereafter, Membertou of his own accord requested
the usual Christian burial, in which resolution he
died, evidently purposing by this act to leave his
faith attested to all Christians and Savages, and to
become a participant in the privileges of the Church.
This Sagamore was in every respect a great man,
not only in the opinion of his own people but in
ours; and the good God seems to have raised this
man's excellent nature high above the ordinary character
of the Canadians, in order that he might gather
him to himself as the first fruits in righteousness
of his race. Out of some 80 natives of New France
whom since the beginning of June of the year
1610 a certain Josse,<a name="endanchor_73._73" id="endanchor_73._73"></a><a href="#endnote_73._73" class="endanchor">73</a>
a priest unfamiliar with his
duties, had heedlessly baptized, although they certainly
had had no religious instruction, Membertou
alone, who greatly excelled all his countrymen in
acuteness and good sense, had wisely discerned how
important it is not merely to be considered a Christian,
but actually to live with a character agreeing to
the name. And indeed, although the entire remainder
of that 80 had continued their brutal mode of life
ever since Baptism, this man alone deserved to be
called a Christian, and indeed led a praiseworthy life
in [577] the midst of dense ignorance, before our brethren
had come thither. As he, first of all the inhabitants
of New France, was sprinkled with the saving waters,
it seems, beyond doubt, that he so imbibed their
most potent virtue, that nothing remained for him but
to secure those teachers, by whose instructions he
would be trained in Christian principles until he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
become fit to introduce among his countrymen an
Apostolic teacher. Our brethren are competent witnesses
of this burning desire; they often heard from
his lips these words: "By the immortal God, Fathers,
endeavor to quickly learn our language, in order that,
after having employed you as teachers, I also, like
you, may go forth as a public exhorter and instructor;
and by our united labors the entire population
of New France may be brought to Christ." This
man, who survived hardly fifteen months after becoming
a Christian, and was accorded but a few days
of our training, was nevertheless rendered illustrious
by many virtues truly Christian and belonging to a
pious spirit; and, indeed, unique marks of an upright
character had presaged in him this fruit which was so
rich, a short time previously, while he was still living
according to his ancestral customs. By the testimony
of all the inhabitants of the province, this one
man, in strength of mind, in knowledge of the military
art, in the great number of his followers, in
power, and in the renown of a glorious name among
his countrymen, and even his enemies, easily surpassed
the Sagamores who had flourished during
many preceding ages. This universal honor and
renown he could not have attained, even among
Savages utterly untaught, except from an established
reputation, the knowledge also of the exceptional
justice of his [578] character, and his temperance.
Indeed, concerning this last virtue, although nothing
additional can be cited, there was certainly a distinguished
example of a man of great self-restraint in
the continual monogamy of Membertou, in which
rank, thus far, New France has recognized him alone
as a ph&oelig;nix indeed. For, though all the rest of
the natives, but especially the Sagamores, covet above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
all else from a multitude of wives a numerous train
of progeny, and desire them as the especial support
and foundation of their power; Membertou could
never be induced to conform to this custom of the
race, because, with a certain wisdom deeper than that
of the mass of Sagamores, he perceived that the evils
arising among the quarreling wives and among the
children of these rivals, beneath the same roof, more
than balanced the increase of resources and of power
that might arise from a large family. It is an observance
of that race, from a superstitious rite which all
especially revere, to never mention by name any deceased
person; but to give each, according to circumstances,
an additional appellation, by which they always
designate him whenever they mention him. In
conformity with this custom, they called Henry Membertou,
because he had of late been highly renowned
in warlike virtues, by a name agreeing with his reputation,
meaning, in their language, Great Chief.</p>

milij copiis abundantes, nauigationem, comite Patre

ad hibernam aliquam annonam frumentaturus. Sed
quòd ex itinere ad Sancti Ioannis flumen, trans Francicum

pæne exclusus est, ad quam deinde cùm est reuersus,
Barbarorum delusus fraude, qui spem frumentariæ
permutationis fecerant, vacuus in Portum Regium
renauigauit. In ea excursione feliciter obtigit
Patri Biardo, vt Pontgrauæo conciliaret Biencourtium,
sicuti nuper Potrincourtium eidem insensum placauerat,
&amp; vt Merueillæo item Maclouiensi, de salute, ob
nescio quas suspiciones, periclitanti grauiter, eadem
pacificationis opera, vitam affereret; quo suo facto
vtrumque sibi magnopere deuinxit. Nostro Sacerdoti
demeritos esse beneficiis homines huiusmodi,
cum ob cætera multa, tum ob id in primis opportunè
accidebat, quòd eorum opera fideli, ac vtili esset vsurus
in disciplina Canadicæ linguæ, quam Pontgrauæus
callebat egregiè, si dies aliquot vnà viuere, aut certè

nõ expeteret, quod expetebat, ipsi vltrò ambiebant,
delato ei perhumaniter suo contubernio; quibus
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
in præsentia Pater egit gratias, habuitque, rogatis
tamen, vt sibi hanc benignitatem, in id tempus reseruarent,
quo bene vti fas esset; tunc enim haud [580]
decere Biencourtium, in periculosa præsertim nauigatione,
ab se deseri. Biencourtio deinde redeunti ex
irrita illa Quinibequiensi frumentatione, quam modò
indicauimus, cùm ad Pentegoetium amnem, &amp; Sanctæ
Crucis insulam ventum esset, suadere conatus est,
immo supplex fuit Pater Biardus, vt se inde, loco ex
propinquo, ad Pontgrauæum dimitteret, Canadici catechismi
contexendi causa, quod inter eos antè conuenerat.
Huic postulationi, licet æquissimæ, is cuius
nihil planè intererat, non nisi eis conditionibus assensus
est, quæ &amp; iniquissimæ, &amp; nequaquam in potestate
Patris essent. Quamobrem facultate deiectus idiomatis
vernaculi condiscendi, ad otiosam pæne vitam in
arce degendam adactus est, ingenti sua molestia.
Nouembri exeunte, iam ferme exausto penu, nulli
nuncij afferebantur è Gallia; &amp; quod reliquum esse
poterat ab venatione subsidium, niuibus obsitũ solum

quem nostrum è Gallia importaueramus, vitam
tolerabat, nihil nobis liberaliùs, quàm cuiuis de calonibus
eo tempore indultum est, neque vt indulgeretur,
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
optauimus, quamquam nebulo quidam, scripto in
Gallia edito, non est veritus multa secus per summam
impudentiam &amp; calumniam disseminare. Ad nonum
calendas Februarias, anni [581] sexcentesimi duodecimi,
tenuerunt cibariorum angustiæ, quem ad diem
in Portum Regium inuecta est nauis cum mediocri
admodum annona, Dominæ Guercheuillææ sumtibus
emta, &amp; transmissa. Mille aureos nummos, ex pacto
societatis cum Robinio &amp; Patribus Canadiensibus initæ,
contributos hæc pia matrona numerauerat Roberto
du Thet, fratri nostro coemendis transmittendisque
Porturegiensi contubernio cibariis; sed eorum
quadringentis fratrem nostrum, non satis cautum depositi
custodem, Potrincourtius oblata suæ syngraphæ
cautione, confestim emunxit; sicque res tota rediit ad
sexcentos, vnde annona nobis exigua conflaretur.
Sed neque tot aureorum cibaria in nauem illata sunt,
nam Potrincourtij naualis administer partem coemti
frumenti auertit in Gallia, &amp; eorum quæ aduecta
erant, Porturegiensi Societati quantum collibuit, nec
amplius, reddidit. Noster Gilbertus du Thet, cuius
in oculis horum pleraque commissa erant, posteà
quam vidit, ab eo qui annonæ transuehendæ præfuerat,
nullas acceptorum rationes referri, assumto Patre
Biardo, apud Biencourtium egit modestè, vti ab eo,
qui mandato parentis eius, pro magistro in naui gesserat,
acceptorum ratio reposceretur: interesse siquidem
nauticorum omnium sociorum, vt constaret,
quantũ à singulis expensum acceptũque esset. Biencourtius
<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>

nihil moderatiùs, nihil æquiùs postulari à quoquam

atrociter insimularetur Simon Imbertus, cuius fides in
[582] eo negotio desiderabatur; ita illius postulata isti
de pinxit, vt eum nobis infensissimum faceret. Imbertus
ergo vt Biencourtium sibi conciliatum à nobis
abalienaret, seque referendæ rationis necessitate absolueret,
malignè interpretatus consilium Dominæ Guercheuillææ,
quæ paciscendæ societatis cum Robinio
ansam captauerat, vt Missionis nostræ rebus tantò certiùs
caueret; fraudulenter cauillatus est, per causam
eius societatis intendi machinã, qua Biencourtiorum

detruderetur. Ex hac calumnia illæ Biencourtij
simultates exstiterunt, quibus factum est, vt nostrorum
opera Nouo-francis populis, quin &amp; ipsis quoque
Gallis nihilo ferè quam isti minùs egentibus institutione,

facile fuit nostris diluere, &amp; semel, iterum, ac
tertiò tam apertè ac validè apud Biencourtium, audiente
vniuerso contubernio, diluerunt; vt postrema
refutatione ad infantiam adactus Imbertus eò
deueniret, vt excusandæ noxæ gratia profiteri non
vereretur, sibi largiter temulento illas aduersum nos

Nostrorum facillima fuit apud Biencourtium

Patrem is adiit, vt quidem eius vultus præferebat,
Patris acerbo casu [584] valdè sollicitus ac mœrens,

ad Biencourtium, itemque ad tuum fratrem, te à

Cui contrà retulit Pater Massæus: Non committam,

Inexspectato, &amp; arguto responso perculsus
Barbarus, quasi ex alto sopore mox ad se rediit, atque
renidenti ore, ait: Iesum igitur tuis precibus tibi propitium
facito, vt te periculo mortis eruat, ne quis in

inquit, Pater, desine esse sollicitus, nec enim me hic

Biardus interea doctore Barbaro vtebatur ad condiscendam

<div class="translation">

<p><span class="smcap">Potrincourt</span>, the father of Biencourt, had sailed
for France in the month of July for the sake of procuring
supplies, of which there was a great scarcity
in the colony at Port Royal; but up to the following
month of October no provisions had been sent from
France; therefore, Biencourt decided to make a trip, in
company with Father Biard, to the Almochiquois, who
lived near the Choüacoet river, [579] and had plenty
of Indian corn, in order by the exchange of French
goods to obtain some food for the winter. But because
he turned aside from the journey across French
Bay, to the St. John river, in order that he might
exact from the young Pontgravé and the rest of the
Maclouins a tax upon their Canadian traffic, and being
longer delayed by disputes which arose with that
colony, he waited almost beyond the time for
obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
corn; and, when he finally returned to that
business, deceived by the pretensions of the Indians,
who had held out the hope of buying food, he sailed
back empty-handed to Port Royal. During this trip
Father Biard fortunately succeeded in reconciling
Biencourt to Pontgravé, just as he had lately conciliated
Potrincourt, who had been enraged at the same
man; and also, by the same office of pacification, in
preserving the life of Merveille, the Malouin, who
was in great jeopardy on account of certain suspicions;
by which actions he acquired the greatest influence
over them both. It was advantageous to our
Priest to have men of this character indebted for favors
to him, not only for many other reasons, but
especially, because he designed to make use of their
faithful and effective services in learning the Canadian
language, in which Pontgravé was unusually
skilled, if they should be allowed to reside together for
a few days, or to meet even more frequently. They,
of their own accord, took care that Father Biard might
not request what he desired, by very politely offering
him the privileges of their home; the Father was
grateful to them, and for the present returned thanks,
requesting them, however, to postpone their kindness
to him until that time when it would be proper
for him to accept it; for it was not then fitting for
him [580] to desert Biencourt, especially when he was
engaged in a dangerous journey. Afterwards, while
Biencourt was returning from that unsuccessful trip to
the Quinibequi for provisions, which we have just described,
when they had arrived at the Pentegoët river
and the island of Ste. Croix, Father Biard endeavored
to persuade him, and even begged him, to send
him to Pontgravé from that place, which was near at
hand, for the purpose of composing a Canadian catechism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
which had previously been agreed upon between
them. To this request, although most just, and
although it certainly made no difference to him, Biencourt
would not consent, except under conditions
which were both exceedingly unjust and by no means
in the power of the Father. Therefore he was disappointed
of the opportunity of learning the language
of the natives, and was compelled to lead an almost
inactive existence in the fort, to his great vexation.
By the end of November, although the provisions
were already almost exhausted, no tidings were received
from France; and what aid they might have
obtained by hunting was cut off by the deep snow
that covered the ground; so it was necessary to exercise
the greatest economy, in order that the provisions
might last longer. The weekly allowance,
therefore, of every one in the colony had finally been
fixed at ten ounces of bread, half a pound of lard,
three dishes of peas or beans, and one of prunes. And,
although the whole colony was living upon the provisions
which we had brought from France for our
own use, we were treated with no more indulgence
at that time than any one of the servants, nor did
we wish for special privileges; although a certain
rascal, in a writing published in France,<a name="endanchor_74._74" id="endanchor_74._74"></a><a href="#endnote_74._74" class="endanchor">74</a>
has not
hesitated to circulate many statements to the contrary,
in the most shameless and calumnious manner.
Until the 24th of January, in the year [581] 1612, the
scarcity of provisions lasted, upon which day a ship
entered Port Royal with a small quantity of supplies,
bought and sent over by Madame de Guercheville.
This pious lady had paid to brother Robert du Thet,
1,000 golden crowns, contributed according to the
agreement between Robin<a name="endanchor_75._75" id="endanchor_75._75"></a><a href="#endnote_75._75" class="endanchor">75</a>
and the Canadian Fathers,
for the purpose of purchasing and conveying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
provisions to the colony at Port Royal; but Potrincourt,
by means of his promissory note, straightway
cheated our brother out of 400, as he was not a
sufficiently careful guardian of his trust, and so the
whole sum was reduced to 600, by means of which a
scanty store was provided for us. But not even provisions
to the value of that number of crowns were
placed in the vessel, for Potrincourt's naval agent<a name="endanchor_76._76" id="endanchor_76._76"></a><a href="#endnote_76._76" class="endanchor">76</a>
embezzled in France part of the grain purchased; and,
of the supplies carried over, he delivered to the Society
at Port Royal as much as he pleased, and no
more. Our brother Gilbert du Thet, before whose
eyes most of these acts had been committed, when he
saw that no account was rendered, by the person in
charge of the transportation of the supplies, of what
had been received by him, in company with Father
Biard modestly requested Biencourt that a reckoning
concerning his trust be demanded from the man who,
by order of his father, had acted as captain of the
vessel; saying that it was to the interest of all the ship's
company that it should be made manifest how much
had been received and expended by each individual.
Biencourt indeed admitted at that time, and often
thereafter, that nothing more modest or more just
could be asked by any person; but, nevertheless, just
as if Simon Imbert, whose account in [582] the matter
was desired, had been cruelly accused by our brother,
he so represented to the former the request of the latter,
that he made him our bitter enemy. Therefore
Imbert, in order to make Biencourt his friend and
alienate him from us, and to release himself from the
necessity of rendering an account, placing an evil interpretation
upon the plan of Madame de Guercheville,
who had taken occasion to make an agreement
between the society and Robin, in order that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
might more securely guard the interests of our Mission,
falsely charged that by means of it a conspiracy
of the society was in progress, by which the authority
of the Biencourts was to be destroyed in the fort at
Port Royal and in the whole of New France. From
this slander arose those quarrels with Biencourt by
which our services were rendered useless to the tribes
of New France, nay, more, to the French themselves,
who needed instruction scarcely less than the natives.</p>

<p>It was easy for our brethren to refute the falsehoods
of their defamer; and once, twice, and a third time
they so plainly and completely disproved them, before
Biencourt, in the hearing of the whole settlement,
that Imbert was rendered speechless by the
final refutation, and was so reduced that he did
not hesitate to claim, for the sake of excusing his
wickedness, that these slanders had been uttered by
him while much intoxicated. Biencourt had been
deeply vexed by the news which was brought, to the
effect that, even with the knowledge of his father, Potrincourt,
the possession and government of the
whole of New France from its greatest river, the Sacqué
to Florida, except Port Royal, had been granted
by a Royal charter to <em>Madame de Guercheville</em>; and
that, by documents under public authority, there had
been transferred to her also by Sieur de Monts everything
which he had recently possessed in this region
by the grant of Henry IV. And, although he could
not suppose that these things were done because of our
[583] influence, still he thereafter acted towards us just
as if he had so believed. The idea of Madame de
Guercheville was, indeed, that their respect for her
authority might serve as a strong restraint to hold to
their duty the Biencourts, both father and son, who
up to this time had kept poor faith with us and felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
little gratitude toward us; but not by any means to
deprive them of their right to Port Royal. But these
men, too fond of their private interests, considered
as an injury to themselves the solicitude of
others in regard to their own affairs; but because
their affairs at home were embarrassed, and they
knew no more convenient source of provisions for
Port Royal than Madame de Guercheville, for the
sake of our Fathers, they silently smothered their
vexation, in order not to lose these supplies. Our
brethren very easily exonerated themselves before
Biencourt, and when he had for the time being accepted
their excuses, and harmony had been restored,
the Fathers returned with great determination to
their purpose of learning the Canadian language, dividing
the business between them, so that Father
Massé should go for this purpose to Louis Membertou,
son of the late Henry: while Father Biard
should have a Savage to teach him the language at
home. While Father Massé, with a young French
companion, was residing with his host at the St. John
river, he fell seriously ill from long fasting and the
continual annoyances of a wandering life; and, although
he did not die, he was reduced to the utmost
weakness. During this illness a very ridiculous
discussion, worthy of a Canadian intellect, took
place between Membertou and his guest, the
Father. The savage approached the prostrate Father,
very anxious and grieved, as his countenance
actually showed, because of the Priest's unfortunate
condition, [584] whom he addressed with these words:
"Hear me, Father, you will surely die, as I indeed anticipate;
write therefore to Biencourt, and also to your
brother, that you have by no means perished at our
hands, but been overcome by disease, in order that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
harm may come to us because of your death." Father
Massé answered him in turn: "I shall not do as
you advise me, and imprudently write to my friends,
lest you should become bolder and more careless, because
of my lack of foresight, and lay violent hands
upon me, while nevertheless possessing my letter as
proof of your innocence, which would save you from
punishment." The Savage, astonished by this unexpected
and keen reply, soon came to himself, as if
from a deep sleep, and said with a smile: "Therefore
make Jesus favorable to you by your prayers, in
order that he may save you from the danger of death,
and no one may lay the blame of your fate upon us."
"I am attending to that very thing," said the Father,
"cease to be anxious, for this disease will not end
me." In the calm of Port Royal Father Biard, in
the meantime, employed a Savage as teacher, that
he might learn the barbarous tongue, which presented
itself as the suitable vehicle for the Gospel
among this utterly rude people. As long as he had
provisions with which to furnish the table for his
teacher, he made progress by the aid of his willing
and efficient services, but after a few weeks the scarcity
of supplies interrupted the course of learning and
teaching. By these difficulties our brethren were also
hindered in the case of four Savages, whom Father
Biard and Biencourt, in a time of peril upon the sea,
had vowed, with the concurrence of the Savages themselves,
to make Christians, if they should safely escape
from the threatened shipwreck. When they were
delivered from this danger, and had brought the ship
to Port Royal, there was nothing in the storehouse
with which to feed the Savages until they should be
suitably instructed in the Catechism; and, because of
this poverty of our brethren, the opportunity of successfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
accomplishing the undertaking passed by,
and did not afterwards recur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> twelfth year of this century had already advanced
to November, when the fact that the scanty
supplies, brought the preceding February, were either
entirely consumed, or reduced to extremely scanty
remnants, caused Biencourt great anxiety, but especially,
because no ship was coming from France.
There had been sent to our brethren privately,
among the preceding February's supplies, four casks
of pure wheat and one of barley, which they had laid
aside for their own use in the future. This grain,
because of the general extremities of the colony, they
judged should be added to the common stock; and
gave it to Biencourt, in order that he might distribute
it for the daily needs of the whole settlement, and
give them an equal allowance each day with the rest
of the people. By this aid the general necessities
were relieved for a time; but for the winter, and
among all that crowd of people, although not numerous,
this was a scanty supply, considering the condition
of the ground, which presented no opportunity
for agriculture, and an uncertain chance for hunting
and fishing. Moreover, even if the weather and the
accessibility of the places had been every way favorable
for fishing, there was still lacking for this pursuit
the necessary aid of a fishing boat. Therefore,
while the rest of the settlers were slothfully enjoying
winter cheer before the blazing hearth, as if forgetful
of their poverty, our brethren devoted their
attention and labor to the construction of a boat.
While they were engaged in this sort of work, the
whole colony guessed and wondered what men so unskilled
in the carpenter's art, unprovided with working tools,
and unsupplied with material, were trying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
to do; they talked a great deal before the hearth [586]
concerning this novel venture, and flung taunts at
these rash Argonauts; but our brethren never left
their work, and hurried on the undertaking. In the
middle of March, to the amazement of their scoffers,
our friends launched their boat, which endured the violence
of the rivers and even of the sea; nor did they
fear, in company with their young servant and another
of the household, to ascend the river flowing
into French Bay, to gather acorns and the Chiquebi
root<a name="endanchor_77._77" id="endanchor_77._77"></a><a href="#endnote_77._77" class="endanchor">77</a>
in the forest. The <em>Chiquebi</em> root is peculiar to
this coast, and is not unlike our potatoes, but more
pleasant and useful for eating; its numerous bulbs,
joined by a slender thread, grow deep in the earth.
However, our collectors found that all the spots
where this root grew had been already visited by
the Savages, who were acquainted with the places;
so that after long search each one of them could
scarcely find a quantity of this food sufficient for
one day. From this harvest of acorns and roots,
since it was of small importance, they turned their
attention to fishing for the <em>Eplanus</em>,<a name="endanchor_36a._36a" id="endanchor_36a._36a"></a><a href="#endnote_36._36" class="endanchor">36</a>
and advanced
their boat, farther toward the head of the
river. The <em>Eplan</em> or <em>Epelan</em> is a little fish of the size
of the Trichia Rothomagensis, that is, of the fish
which is commonly called the <em>Sardine</em>; and, in the beginning
of April, it leaves the ocean, and in great
shoals enters the fresh-water streams, where it lays
the eggs for its abundant young, these streams being
very numerous four leagues from the post at Port
Royal. Fishing for the Eplanus was succeeded by
that for the Halecis, and for other sorts of river and
sea-fishes, just as opportunity and suitable place
offered for capturing each, up to the month of May;
but, contrary to what they most of all wished, our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
fishermen, [587] with the hook or net of the Gospel,
took only a very few men in the immense Ocean of
the Canadian tribes.</p>

<div class="translation">

<p><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> in France the authority of the Queen
was interposed, that we might at the first opportunity
be relieved from our bondage at Port Royal,
and that we might be allowed, in any part of
New France, either to study the language of the natives,
or practice among the Savages what we had already
learned by our own right, and seeking the permission
of no man. Therefore two of our members,
provided with a Royal commission for this undertaking,&mdash;Father
Quintin,<a name="endanchor_78._78" id="endanchor_78._78"></a><a href="#endnote_78._78" class="endanchor">78</a>
and he who previously had
sailed from Port Royal for France, Gilbert du Thet,&mdash;safely
and joyfully reached the coast of New France
in the middle of May of the year 1613. It was provided
in the commission that we should be allowed
to establish a new settlement in a suitable place, and
to have a sufficient number of colonists to protect it;<a name="endanchor_79._79" id="endanchor_79._79"></a><a href="#endnote_79._79" class="endanchor">79</a>
and for its provision there had generously been sent
a year's supply of food for thirty persons, and also
horses, goats, and other things of the sort. By the
kindness of the Queen there were also added weapons
for our defense, some supplies, and also four
military tents, by which we might be sheltered while
our new residence was being built. La Saussaye,
with a military title and command, was to have
charge of the household of colonists, not only while
the buildings were in process of erection, but also
when they had been completed and fortified, in order
that in case of attack nothing might be neglected,
but the entire colony should be in a condition of defense,
and the buildings in good repair. When the
supplies were landed at Port Royal, only five of us
were there, out of the whole population, Biencourt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
being absent with the others. When the letter of the
Queen, [588] in which were orders for our dismissal,
had been read to Hèbert,<a name="endanchor_80._80" id="endanchor_80._80"></a><a href="#endnote_80._80" class="endanchor">80</a>
who represented Biencourt,
we were allowed to collect our baggage; having
done this, two days later we left Port Royal, with
the intention of founding a new settlement in the
neighborhood of Norembega. The boatmen had
been notified, according to their agreement, to land
at <em>Kadesquit</em>,<a name="endanchor_81._81" id="endanchor_81._81"></a><a href="#endnote_81._81" class="endanchor">81</a>
a harbor on the shore of Norembega,
in order that the whole colony might there disembark,
and auspiciously take possession of a site for the future
settlement upon the neighboring hills; but when
we had stuck in a bay, this side of that,<a name="endanchor_82._82" id="endanchor_82._82"></a><a href="#endnote_82._82" class="endanchor">82</a>
to which
from the favorable outcome, we gave the name of St.
Sauveur, they declared that they had abundantly fulfilled
their agreement, and that they would not continue
the voyage any further. During this dispute,
we engaged in conversation with the Savages inhabiting
the spot; and since they praised their own country
as being far superior to that at Kadesquit, and
earnestly solicited us to choose it for our settlement,
we conceived a desire to explore it. After we
had examined this region, which was heartily approved
by all, the whole company turned their attention
to selecting a site for the building upon a suitable
hill. Therefore, a Cross was erected, by way of
consecrating the place; the ground was marked out
for the erection of the buildings; the earth was dug
up for laying the foundations; and our abode, while
still in its infancy, was called by the same name as
the harbor, St. Sauveur. La Saussaye, the commander
of the colonists, took, from the beginning, so
deep an interest in agriculture that he thought of that
alone, and neglected everything else; and through
his excessive zeal for husbandry, called off a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
portion of the colony from the work of building, and
set them to farming. La Motte,<a name="endanchor_83._83" id="endanchor_83._83"></a><a href="#endnote_83._83" class="endanchor">83</a>
Saussaye's Lieutenant,
Ronseraye, the Color-bearer, Joubert, the Drill-master,
and other leading men of the Company were
of the opinion that, postponing all other enterprises,
the building [589] ought to be completed, and the energies
of the entire company be devoted to this, until it
should be protected by fortifications against hostile
violence, and might safely be inhabited. Wherefore,
they were greatly displeased because most of the
colonists were taken away from building and employed
in plowing by La Saussaye, whom they eagerly
urged to apply the labors and zeal of all in building,
a more profitable undertaking for the present;
but it fell upon deaf ears. So, as the views and plans
of the leaders were at variance, disputes arose, such
as usually take place between those who differ, when
each one thinks that what he deems best ought to be
preferred to the projects and undertakings of others;
the result was, that days were idly spent, away from
work, in quarreling. This inactivity, and obstinacy
in contrary opinions, so inimical to Christian interests
and the Divine worship upon that shore, God
seems to have willed to punish by means of an unforeseen
calamity.</p>

quin chirographo suo erat testatus, hanc suam fuisse
optionem, quæ reuera erat optio certissimi naufragij.

quoad inuentæ essent Gallicæ naues, opimus
piscatus bis subleuauit; varius item Barbarorum in

in propinquo littore ad Sesamabræum, &amp; Passepecum
portum versari geminas naues reditum in
Franciam adornantes. Eò cùm citissimè cursum direxissent
duæ lintres, opportunè adfuerunt, antè

De Patribus autem Biardo &amp; Quintino, vti diximus,
conuenerat, [596] vt in insulas Peucoïtias transuecti,
opera piscatorum Anglorum inde in Franciam deportarentur:
sed mutata pòst sententia, in Virginiã sunt
destinati, cùm in captiuam nauem cui Turnellus præerat,
essent impositi cum aliis quinque de contubernio,
cæteris octo sociis in Argalli Prætoriam ingressis.
Virginiensis præsidij præfectus de captiuis Iesuitis
nescio quid inaudierat, eisque diras cruces struebat,
cuius decreti nuncius ad nostros in naues &amp; ad cæteros
captiuos aduolarat, qui nonnullis nocturnam quietem
adimeret, nec ille quidẽ inani rumore nixus; cùm
enim ad Virginiam naue appulsi essent nostri, eius
furori destinabantur. Argallus autem, qui fidem
suam nostris obligasset, vt suo nomine ac genere dignum
erat, intrepidè acriterque Præfecto suppliciis
nostros addicenti obstitit, seque incolumi captiuis suis
nihil periculi futurum asseuerauit: Præfecto tamen

<span class="pagenuml"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
quo nostra colonia in Nouam-Frãciam deducebatur,
protulit, cuius auctoritate repressus Præfectus vltrà
tendere non ausus est. Coacto posteà concilio, cùm
de re tota deliberaretur accuratiùs, ab omnibus itum
est in eam sententiam, vt Argallus cum triplici instructa
naue in Nouam-Frãciam Iesuitas reduceret;
eos inde cum certis captiuis in Galliam transmitteret;
Saussæium, &amp; eius cohortem militarem, quæ in Porturegiensi
arce præsidere, falsò tamen, dicebatur, in

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> English, a few years before, had occupied Virginia,
which John Verazano, in 1523, had explored
under the authority of Francis I., King of France,
and brought under his jurisdiction. It is the portion
of the continent between Florida and New France,
which, covering the thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh, and
thirty-eighth parallels, was formerly called by the
name of <em>Mocosa</em>,<a name="endanchor_84._84" id="endanchor_84._84"></a><a href="#endnote_84._84" class="endanchor">84</a>
situated two hundred and fifty
leagues Westward from the station at St. Sauveur.
From the fort [at Jamestown], which they have held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
for eight years, strongly fortified and occupied by
a garrison of soldiers, they make a voyage every summer
to the fishing grounds of the Peucoit<a name="endanchor_85._85" id="endanchor_85._85"></a><a href="#endnote_85._85" class="endanchor">85</a>
islands,
to obtain fish [590] for food during the coming winter.
While they were sailing thither in the summer
of this year, they encountered the heavy fogs which
commonly prevail upon this sea during these months;
and while they were thus long delayed, and ignorant
of their situation, they were gradually borne by the
currents to our shore, not far from the harbor of St.
Sauveur. Then, by the information of the Savages,
who sinned unwittingly, and took them for friendly
Frenchmen, they learned that there was a French
ship in the next bay, and that, too, not a large vessel,
nor defended by a numerous crew, and but lightly
armed with brass cannon. Of course, no more welcome
news than this could come to half-naked men,
whose stock of provisions was exhausted,&mdash;men
who, in addition to this poverty, were incited by an
inborn love of robbery, and an expectation of greater
booty than could have been obtained from the plunder
of our ship, to willingly employ violence, even
against natural justice and the law of nations. So
they prepared their weapons, and under full sail, and
with decks cleared for action, entered directly into
our harbor.<a name="endanchor_86._86" id="endanchor_86._86"></a><a href="#endnote_86._86" class="endanchor">86</a>
When the Savage by whose information
we had been especially betrayed perceived from
these signs the hostile intentions of the English towards
us, he at once recognized his mistake, and with
many tears declared that he had been at fault toward
us whom he thought to please. These lamentations
he often thereafter repeated, when he sought pardon
from us for his error, and even from his Savage countrymen,
who considered our misfortune their own injury,
and often threatened him with violence. Meanwhile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
we were in doubt whether we should judge as
friends or enemies those whom an in-shore breeze was
bearing straight towards our position; [591] while the
pilot of the ship set out to meet and reconnoiter them
in a small boat, by a long circuit, however, in order
that he might not be left without a way of retreat,
but especially because the wind was contrary to
him, but favorable to the strangers. But there was
no need of reconnoitering, for they advanced, sounding
the signal for battle, only reserving their fire until
they could use it at close quarters, and aim at the
defenders of the ship one by one. With fourteen
great cannon, and sixty guns of the larger size, which
they call <em>Mosquets</em>, they made their attack upon our
ship, which was unprepared for sailing because the
anchors had not been raised, and was furnished with
only ten defenders, while the gunner of the brass cannon
was absent; and so the capture of our ship and
all of us, whom La Saussaye had scattered about upon
the shore, was a matter of no great difficulty. Our
brother Gilbert du Thet was assisting in the defence
of the vessel, when an especially violent shower of
bullets assailed them, in which he was stricken with
a mortal wound; and, although attended with great
devotion by an English surgeon who was a Catholic,
on the following day he died most piously, after receiving
the consolation of the Sacraments. But all of
us had come into the power of the English Heretic,<a name="endanchor_87._87" id="endanchor_87._87"></a><a href="#endnote_87._87" class="endanchor">87</a>
who, being extremely crafty, secretly abstracted from
La Saussaye's trunk, the Royal commission, upon
which authority rested the entire establishment of
our colony in New France, in order that he might appear
to treat with us not as a robber, but upon an
equal footing; and then he began to urge La Saussaye
to prove by what right he had planted a settlement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
upon the shores of Canada. When La Saussaye
had cited the authority and commission of the King
of France, which important document he declared
that he had in his chest, his baggage, [592] of which
he still retained the keys, was brought, and he was
ordered to produce it; but when he opened the chest,
La Saussaye recognized everything else untouched
and in its proper place, but no commission appeared.
When this was not forthcoming, the English Commander
assumed a severe countenance and tone, and
was deeply angered, calling us all runaways and mere
pirates, and, declaring us worthy of death, handed
over our property to his crew to be pillaged, and,
finally, treated us as enemies. Now it seemed probable
that the English, unless they should quickly be
hindered, were about to cover up the outrage which
they had already begun, with some greater crime, in
order that they might conceal the memory of the
previous injury by a fresh offence. Wherefore
our brethren approached the Captain; frankly revealed
themselves to him, as he was still ignorant of
their identity; and begged him not, in elation over
his easy victory, to adopt severe measures against
their colony; they earnestly warned him to remember
the conditions of human life, saying that just as he
would wish his own interests mildly handled, if a
similar calamity had fallen upon him, so he ought to
act humanely in the case of others; moreover, that
he should especially consider that he was dealing
with innocent men, to whom no fault could be
charged beyond the fact that, because of their blamelessness,
they had been too careless in a peaceful
spot. They were heard somewhat kindly by the Captain,
and received with respectful address; the only
thing of which he disapproved being that Fathers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
the Society, who had commonly so good a reputation
for piety and wisdom, should be among a band of
runaways and pirates. When our brethren had proved
by strong evidence the entire blamelessness of their
colony, not only in respect to their honorable life in
other ways, but also in that which was the subject of
the conversation, the Captain seemed [593] to yield his
assent, and to find as the only fault in us our neglect
to preserve the commission of our expedition. From
that time on, he treated our Fathers with great
consideration, and received them in all matters with
honor, and with kindness at his table. In the meantime
he was troubled because the pilot<a name="endanchor_88._88" id="endanchor_88._88"></a><a href="#endnote_88._88" class="endanchor">88</a>
of our ship
had escaped, together with a part of the crew; and
he feared that harm might in some way fall upon
himself, because of the pilot's being free to announce
what had taken place; and the more so, because the
latter came in his boat at night to the captured ship
and took off from it the rest of the crew. This pilot,
indeed, although a Calvinist, came by night to Father
Biard, and, taking him by the hand, with many protestations
bade him and the other Fathers to expect
from him, as far as faithfulness and devotion could
go toward another, all the services of a Christian and
a fellow-countryman, and to be persuaded that he
would neglect nothing which might contribute to
their safety; to employ his aid freely, and consider
what they should decide upon, as to making their escape.
Father Biard thanked him profusely, and
promised that he would remember such earnest good-will
towards himself and his associates; but added,
that he would make no plans concerning himself until
he should see the entire colony placed in safety,
and then he would leave to God the decision of
his own case; that in the meantime the pilot ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to look out for himself, as the English Captain was
making every effort to capture him. When the pilot
had received these warnings, in order that he might
cause the English to think he had gone away, three
days afterwards, fearlessly, and with taunting [594]
expression and words, he passed in his boat before the
faces of the angry English, as if he were hastening to
seek refuge with some French ship of which he knew;
and, while pretending to go farther, turned about behind
a neighboring island and there lay in hiding to
observe the outcome of our capture. While we were
wavering between the doubtful chance of either death
or imprisonment, our Savage acquaintances, having
received the news of our calamity, visited us in great
numbers, deeply pitying our misfortune, and most
dutifully offering us the use of their scanty resources
for the whole coming year, if we were willing to remain
among them. However, Argall the English Captain,
and his Lieutenant Turnell,<a name="endanchor_89._89" id="endanchor_89._89"></a><a href="#endnote_89._89" class="endanchor">89</a> had decided upon
milder measures toward us, in appearance certainly,
than we at first expected; indeed, they had agreed
with La Saussaye, the Leader of our colony, to send
us back to France; but the conditions of return
were of such a character that they differed little from
our certain destruction. There was allowed to us,
although numbering thirty persons, only one boat,
which could not hold us all, even if we were crowded
together as closely as possible; and these conditions,
La Saussaye had accepted, nay, more, he had borne
witness with his own handwriting that this had been
his preference, which was really the choice of certain
shipwreck. However, the efforts of our Brethren
prevailed, that the whole colony should not together
incur imminent danger; and it was allowed that only
fifteen should be placed on board the boat, of whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
one should be Father Massé, while the two remaining
Fathers should be carried to the Peucoit islands and
entrusted to English fishermen for conveyance to
France. The rest of the colonists were, in accordance
with their own desire, to be carried to Virginia.
Therefore one portion of the settlers, under the lead
of La Saussaye, entered the boat to set out for
France, although ignorant of the region and of seamanship,
[595] and unprovided with charts, to whom
God in time sent the Calvinistic pilot, who had taken
great pains to observe the fortunes of his countrymen,
in order that if any opportunity should offer, he
might bear aid to them in their distress. He had
landed upon the continent, and, in the Canadian manner
of life and custom, like one of the Savages, was
traversing the entire coast, in order to ascertain our
condition, when very fortunately he happened upon
the boat which had set out. Upon being received on
board, he showed himself a truly able leader in their
perplexities, and united his boat and fourteen sailors
to ours as comrades in the voyage and its labors. Up
to the time the French ships were found, a lucky
catch of fish twice assuaged their hunger; they were
also aided by various meetings with the Savages upon
that coast, of whom Louis Membertou received them,
when famishing, with a liberal present of elk meat,<a name="endanchor_90._90" id="endanchor_90._90"></a><a href="#endnote_90._90" class="endanchor">90</a>
Roland and some other Sagamores furnished a supply
of bread, and others most generously gave a
bountiful provision of fish and birds. But of all
blessings, the most grateful was the news, which the
Sagamore Roland gave us, that on the neighboring
coast, at Sesambre and Passepec<a name="endanchor_91._91" id="endanchor_91._91"></a><a href="#endnote_91._91" class="endanchor">91</a> harbor, were two
ships preparing to return to France. The two boats,
quickly directing their course thither, fortunately
arrived before the vessels left; and, all having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
been received on board, they made sail and arrived
safe and sound at St. Malo, a town in Brittany, where
Father Massé was received with the greatest kindness
and generosity by the Bishop of St. Malo and
the magistrates and people of the town. Moreover,
concerning Fathers Biard and Quintin, as we have
said, it had been decided [596] that they should be
conducted to the Peucoit islands, and thence, by the
aid of the English fishermen, should be conveyed
to France; but these plans having afterward been
changed, it was resolved that they should be sent to
Virginia, they, with five others of the colonists, being
placed on board the captured vessel, which was
in command of Turnell, while eight other settlers
had entered Captain Argall's ship. The governor of
Virginia had heard something concerning the captive
Jesuits, and was preparing severe punishment for
them; this news had come to our brethren and the
rest of the prisoners on board the ships, and deprived
some of their nightly rest. This report did not rest
on idle rumor, for when the ship bearing our brethren
had reached Virginia, they were exposed to
his fury. Argall, however, who had given his word
to our brethren, boldly and vehemently, as was fitting
his name<a name="endanchor_92._92" id="endanchor_92._92"></a><a href="#endnote_92._92" class="endanchor">92</a>
and race, opposed the Governor in his
attempt to punish them, and declared that, as long as
he lived, no danger should befall his prisoners. But,
when the Governor obstinately persisted in his purpose,
Argall produced the Royal charter, in dependence
upon which our colony had been introduced into
New France; and by its authority the Governor was
restrained, and dared proceed no farther. In a meeting
of the council, therefore, the whole affair was
more carefully discussed, and all agreed upon the decision
that Argall, with three ships, should take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Jesuits back to New France; that he should thence
send them and certain other prisoners to France; that
he should chastise La Saussaye and his military force,
who were said, although falsely, to be in possession
of the fort at Port Royal; and that he should plunder
and level with the ground all the houses of the
French. He therefore returned to that coast of New
France occupied by the French, where he despoiled
and burned the forts of Ste. [597] Croix and Port Royal,
which were bare of defenders, destroyed all evidences
of the French occupation, and erected English
monuments in various places, declaring the whole
coast to be under the sway of the British King.
While Father Biard was present during these proceedings,
his life was twice endangered, because he
had dissuaded Argall with many words from entering
Port Royal, on the ground that there would be no
profit in the undertaking, from which they, nevertheless,
afterwards obtained an uncommon booty; because
he was unwilling to become a guide to those
places where plunder was sought; moreover, because
slanders had been uttered against him by some
Frenchmen in that region; for all of which reasons
he offended Argall and Turnell deeply, to his own
great peril.</p>

<div class="translation">
<p><span class="smcap">Argall</span> left Port Royal and started for Virginia in
the early part of November of the year 1613, but, on
the day after he set sail, an exceedingly violent storm
arose, by which the ships were driven asunder in
very diverse directions. Captain Argall's vessel, indeed,
was finally borne to Virginia; the smaller of
the two captured ships, with its crew, was never seen
thereafter; the larger of these, which Turnell commanded,
and on board of which we were, after being
dreadfully beaten for sixteen days by continuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
tempests, had reached almost desperate straits, because
of the exhaustion of its provisions, when the
storm finally ceased, and we resumed our voyage towards
Virginia with a favoring wind. We were distant
not more than twenty-five leagues from the coast
of Virginia, where the Governor was planning our
destruction, and for this reason the voyage was hateful
to us; when a contrary wind which suddenly arose
turned our bow towards the <em>Asores</em> islands of Portugal,
[598] situated at a distance of almost 700 leagues due
East from that point. Since the force of this wind did
not at all abate, Turnell foresaw that his life would
be endangered should he come into the power of the
Portuguese, because he was conveying as prisoners,
Priests, who, with the greatest injustice, had been torn
from their settlement and despoiled; and he was
still more troubled because, persuaded by the false
charges of the French at Port Royal, he believed Father
Biard to be a Spaniard, so that he dreaded, with
good reason, a denunciation of his offense before the
Portuguese, if our Fathers should resolve to accuse
him. Therefore he frankly acknowledged that the
power of the Deity, which avenges injury done to
the innocent, was deservedly hostile to him and his
upon that voyage; and, overcome by this calamity,
although he had, through his own fault in rashly believing
slanders, been extremely unfriendly to Father
Biard up to that time, he began to soften greatly and
become more amiable toward him. Moreover, even
if the force of the wind were not driving them to the
<em>Asores</em>, still, scarcity of provisions and fresh water
compelled them to go thither, though against their
will; wherefore, it was necessary for Turnell to take
precautions lest the presence of our Fathers should
cause him damage; as no danger was to be feared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
from them, if the ship should remain at a distance at
anchor, and the necessary provisions should be secured
by sending a small boat into the harbor, as the
Captain hoped to do. Matters turned out, however,
contrary to his expectations; for when we approached
Faëal, one of the Asores islands, we were compelled
to enter the inmost harbor, and take a position among
the other ships under the eyes of the inhabitants.
Having entered thither a little too swiftly, when our
vessel collided with a Spanish treasure-ship [599] and
carried away its forward jib, the Spanish Captain
shouted out that we were pirates, and aroused his
crew to arms. A few weeks before, a Frenchman had
plundered a ship in the same harbor by a sudden attack;
whence the Spaniards, fearing a similar fate,
had been the more alarmed on this occasion, and
thought an investigation still more necessary in the
case of an Englishman. Turnell was therefore
obliged to disembark upon the land, where the Spanish
held him as a hostage while the interior of the ship
was being thoroughly searched, the Fathers, in the
meantime, carefully hiding behind a boat, in order
that the Englishman might suffer no harm on their
account if they should be discovered. Concealment
was very difficult in a place not at all convenient, as
the affair arose very suddenly, and there were so
careful searchers, who rummaged the entire interior
of the ship; but our brethren escaped their lynx eyes,
greatly to their own delight, because they had thus
preserved the Englishman; but with greater pleasure
to the Englishman, because he recognized that he
had been saved, contrary to his expectations and his
deserts, by those whom he had most wickedly deprived
of their liberty. This service and remarkable
good-faith the English recognized at that time with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
marked signs of gratitude, and often thereafter spoke
of the Fathers with great praise, especially before
their Ministers. Three entire weeks the English
ship remained in that harbor, and the same length of
time the Fathers were hidden away and deprived of
the sunlight; then, abandoning the voyage to Virginia,
Turnell proceeded to Britain. But, when a
storm had diverted us from the direct prosecution of
our voyage, it carried us violently Westward to the
coast of Vuallia;<a name="endanchor_93._93" id="endanchor_93._93"></a><a href="#endnote_93._93" class="endanchor">93</a>
and when here provisions failed the
ship, Turnell entered the town of Pembroke [600] for
the sake of obtaining supplies. The officials of this
town suspected him of piracy upon the high seas, because,
although an Englishman, he was sailing in a
French vessel, and produced no written testimonials
of the authority under which he was making his voyage;
and when he made oath that he had been separated
by a storm from his Captain, Argall, he was not
believed. When, therefore, every sort of evidence
had failed him, he cited as witnesses for his statements
the two Jesuits whom he had on board the ship,
whose incorruptible integrity, he said, no mortal
could deservedly call in question. Therefore, when
the Fathers had been very respectfully interrogated,
and had given their testimony in public before
the magistrate, Turnell was placed in honor, and
was believed to have done everything honestly, as
befitted a gentleman; but our brethren were treated
with distinction, and were entertained as guests by
the <em>Mayor of the City</em>, as he is called, that is, the
Magistrate of the common people. When Nicholas
Adams, who then represented the Minister of the
marine at Pembroke, and in the presence of whom
our brethren had given their testimony, heard that
they had extremely bad fare upon the ship, he directed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
that they should be entertained at the home of
the Magistrate whom we have mentioned, and that
upon his own responsibility everything should be
abundantly supplied to them; and if they should lack
the means to repay him, he said that for the sake of
God he would willingly do them the favor of meeting
the expense, because he thought it very unbecoming
that no kindness should be shown among the
citizens of Pembroke to men distinguished in every
way for merit and learning. A message had been
sent to the King of Britain concerning our brethren;
and, while an answer thereto was being awaited,
many came, for the purpose of seeing and conversing
with the fathers, from the ranks of the nobles, of the
officials, and even of the ministers, [601] four of
whom one of the councilors put into the arena of
debate with our brethren, with the desire of testing
their doctrine. Moreover, when their case had been
reported at Court, the ambassador<a name="endanchor_94._94" id="endanchor_94._94"></a><a href="#endnote_94._94" class="endanchor">94</a> of the Most
Christian King had already heard that a ship with
French Jesuits had been captured, and urged the release
of all and especially of our brethren, because he
had from his King strict commands to this effect.
There was therefore no delay in the conveyance of
our brethren from Pembroke to Dover, whence, after
a short passage, they safely and joyfully arrived, after
almost ten months of captivity, at Itius Portus,<a name="endanchor_95._95" id="endanchor_95._95"></a><a href="#endnote_95._95" class="endanchor">95</a> a
town on the French coast. Here they were received
most honorably, with especial kindness and favor
from Sieur d'Arquien, Commander of the Royal garrison,
and Dean Boulaye; a suitable viaticum was
also given to them, which was abundant for their
needs during the trip to their College at Ambians<a name="endanchor_96._96" id="endanchor_96._96"></a><a href="#endnote_96._96" class="endanchor">96</a>

<div class="translation">
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> he who measures the undertaking by ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
standards, will not easily see how greatly the work of
the Mission of New France has advanced the Christian
religion among the Savages; he who will fairly
estimate an enterprise very difficult in its nature, and
greatly hindered also by the interruption of calamities
from without; must confess that the rugged soil has
been prepared for the seed of the Gospel with very
advantageous and glorious beginnings. For, in the
first place, is it not a great thing, I ask, that a race of
utterly brutal disposition and manners, lately keeping
itself far aloof from all external intercourse, extremely
suspicious by reason of its impotence, should
be now so conciliated towards us, and entertain
such sentiments for our brethren, that Savages of
every tribe seek them out with the greatest pains,
[602] desire them to have a residence in their territory,
offer them annual supplies from their scanty
store, testify by grief and weeping to their longing
for them, and regard the English, the enemies of our
peace, with implacable hatred? It is indeed something
great, and of the utmost importance to the implanting
of the faith in those minds, that they meet
its heralds with such emphatic good-will, confidence,
and veneration. Moreover there is another influence
far greater, and so much the more powerful in effecting
the salvation of the Savages as it is remote from
the sphere of human affections and more characteristic
of heavenly emotions. Already there has become
deeply seated in the minds of the Canadians the belief
that those who die without Baptism are consigned
to eternal torments; consequently, as long as they
are in health, they do not readily submit to the
rules of the Christian faith, which to their ideas are
a little too harsh; but when at the point of death,
they regard Baptism as certainly a great blessing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
and eagerly seek it. Since they have the Fathers of
the Society as authorities for this doctrine, and have
absorbed it into their inmost souls, of their own accord
they warn and remind their Teachers of it, whenever
any one of their friends is prostrated by some
severe complaint, and urge them to anticipate the
death of the patient by sprinkling him with the saving
waters, before he shall perish. And, indeed,
these emotions of the mind, in men who are in other
respects most savage, two Fathers have created by a
training of two years, and that indeed not continuous,
but interrupted by numerous difficulties, which is
certainly no light incentive toward propagating the
seed of the Gospel among that race with flourishing
increase. To this propagation, the unaccustomed
power of holy prayers and of Baptism, [603] sometimes
disclosed among this people in several remarkable
instances, seems likely to be no small incentive in
the future. When Father Biard was occupied one
day at the river of the Eplan fish, a message was
brought to him from a sick woman at the point of
death, who was very anxious to see and converse
with him, at Bay Ste. Marie, two leagues from that
river. He had one of the colonists as a guide thither,
and found the woman lying, according to the manner
of her race, near the hearth, and now miserably languishing
in the third week of her illness. He instructed
the invalid, as far as her disease permitted,
in the necessary parts of the Catechism; strengthened
her by prayers adapted to the circumstances,
and a cross hung upon her breast; and directed that
he should be called, if she should thereafter grow
worse. The next day the woman arose from the
hearth entirely well, and, loaded with a heavy bag,
started briskly for her husband, who was at a distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
of four leagues. A Calvinist from Dieppe first
of all observed this cure, and immediately ran to Father
Biard to announce the wonderful event. The
same Father was with Biencourt on the banks of the
Pentegoët, where, according to his custom, he was
going about among the cabins of the Savages, visiting
and comforting the sick and aiding them with
prayers and Christian instruction. There a sick man
was lying, who had already been ill three months,
whose recovery had been despaired of, and whom
the Savages brought to the Father's notice. He was
completely bathed in cold perspiration, an almost
certain sign of death, since a heavy fever had taken
possession of him. After prayers had been said and
a short lesson in the faith given, when the Father
had held out a cross to him to be repeatedly kissed,
and had left it hanging about his neck, many Savages
listening to him, and heartily [604] approving
what was done, he returned to the ship and Biencourt.
But the next day, when Biencourt was engaged
upon the ship in trading with the natives, that sick
man, yesterday at the point of death, came on board
in a state of health, and, joyfully and reverently displaying
the cross, went to Father Biard, and, testifying
with great delight to his recovery, ascribed it
to the power of the Holy Cross. That which follows
is much more remarkable, and by the Savages
was ascribed solely to the merit of Baptism. Father
Biard, La Motte, the Lieutenant of La Saussaye, and
Simon the Interpreter, had gone together to examine
the site selected for the settlement of St. Sauveur.
While returning thence, they heard at a distance a
lamentable wail, and, when they asked of their Savage
companion the cause of this mournful outcry,
the answer was made that it was the customary token
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
that some one had already departed this life. But
as they approached nearer to the huts of the Savages,
a boy, on being questioned, informed them that the
lamentation was not for a dead, but for a dying person;
and, turning to Father Biard, he said: "Why
do you not hurry thither, if perchance you may find
him still living, and administer Baptism before his
death?" The voice of that boy, just as though sent
from heaven, caused the Father and his companions
to run swiftly, and as they reached the rude dwellings,
there appeared a great crowd of Savages, drawn up in
regular order, standing in the open air; and among
this mournful-looking company a father walked
about, in whose arms a delicate boy was dying. As
the child struggled for breath, hastening towards
death, and weakly gasping, it tortured the unfortunate
parent with grief and sorrow. Moreover, at each gasp
of the infant, the father wailed dreadfully, and his
lamentation was immediately answered by a howl
from the gloomy throng of Savages standing near. [605]
Father Biard went to the afflicted parent of the boy,
and asked whether he might, with his consent, baptize
the dying child. The Savage, overcome by the
depth of his grief, could not utter a word; but his
action showed, by placing the child in the arms of
the petitioner, what he desired. The Father asked
for water, and giving the child to La Motte to hold,
who eagerly received it, he sprinkled it with the saving
waters, christened it Nicholas de la Motte, and
formulating a prayer, begged from God light for the
Savages, that they might recognize the immense blessings
of the faith. After this prayer he took the infant
from the hands of La Motte and gave it to its
mother, who was present; the mother immediately
gave her breast to the child, who greedily accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
it, partook of the milk to satiety, and finally lived,
healthy and vigorous. In the meantime, the whole
circle of Savages who had stood about, struck by the
marvelousness of the unusual occurrence, remained
motionless as stones, and stood silently in their
tracks. Therefore, while they were thus prepared
in mind, our brother addressed to them such words
as seemed appropriate to the subject in hand; and
when he had finished, bade them depart to their
own huts. As they, trembling and reverential, received
his discourse, with the greatest respect, so
when, the object of their gathering having been accomplished,
he ordered them to depart to their huts,
they slipped away, silently exhibiting this unusual
obedience, quietly and quickly, each to his own
dwelling. Whoever shall carefully examine these
and other like acts which have been performed in the
sight of the Savages, greatly to their astonishment,
and no less to their benefit, will justly conclude that
the Mission of New France has been commenced
under very advantageous beginnings.</p>

<p>Our copy of Biard's letter (written in French) to

<p>We follow the style and make-up of O'Callaghan's
Reprint of Biard's <em>Missio Canadensis</em>, designated as
"No. 1" in the Lenox Catalogue. According to Sommervogel's
<em>Bibliothèque de la Campagnie de Jésus</em> (Paris,
1890), vol. i., p. 1439, this document was originally
published in the <em>Annuæ Litteræ Societatis Jesu</em>, an.
1611 (Dillingen, n. d.), pp. 121-143. The British
Museum has a copy of this volume of <em>Annuæ Litteræ</em>,
described in its catalogue as published at "Dilingæ
[1615?]." Sommervogel adds, regarding <em>Missio Canadensis</em>:
"Was it not published separately? I find it
thus indicated in the catalogue of Mr. Parison, no.
1786." According to a letter written by Father
Carrère (June 17, 1890) to Father Jones, of Montreal,
the original MS. of this letter was then in the
archives of Roder, France.</p>

<p>In Carayon's <em>Première Mission</em> (pp. 77-105) there
is given a French version of this letter.</p>

<p>It is internally evident that the letter was
commenced January 22nd, and finished "vltimo die
Januarÿ." In Father Martin's MS. (translated) copy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
preserved in the Library of Parliament, at Ottawa,
he wrote upon it the former date, and it is so calendared
in the catalogue of that library. Carayon
first applied to it the latter date. This of itself has
led to some bibliographical confusion.</p>

<p>In Carayon's <em>Bibliographie Historique de la Compagnie
de Jésus</em> (Paris, 1864), p. 178, a notice of the original
publication is thus given: "P. Biard.&mdash;Epistola ad

only original of which the present editor has knowledge;
it is not listed in Gagnon's <em>Essai de Bibliographie

was edited by L. Lafaist ("L. Cimber," <em>pseud.</em>) and
F. Danjou, assistants in the Bibliothèque Nationale,
Paris; the second series (12 vols.), by Danjou alone,
who, on the title of tome viii. of this series, is styled
"Bibliothécaire de l'Arsenal." The 27 volumes
were published at Paris between 1834 and 1840.</p>

<p>The orthography of the printed original of the

(p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>).&mdash;In their first voyage (1604), De Monts and Poutrincourt
visited and named the river St. John; and at the mouth
of the Rivière des Etechemins (so named by Champlain; by the
Indians called Scoodick or Schoodic), they found an island which
they called St. Croix, a name in later days given to the river itself.
It lies in the middle of the river, opposite to the dividing line between
Calais and Robbinston, Me. Here De Monts, Champlain,
and their 77 fellows spent a miserable winter, while Poutrincourt returned
to France for colonists and supplies to plant his proposed
settlement at Port Royal. Thirty-five of the St. Croix party had
died of scurvy before relieved in June, 1605, by Pontgravé, De
Monts' lieutenant. In August, after a fruitless voyage along the
New England coast, De Monts took his party to Port Royal, and
there began a settlement before Pontgravé's arrival. Biard's letter,
indicates that winter fur-trading posts were maintained both at St.
Croix and on the St. John, for several years thereafter.&mdash;See Parkman's
<em>Pioneers</em>, pp. 291-293.</p>

<p>Champlain's chart of the island may be found in his <em>Voyages</em>
(Prince Soc.), vol. ii., p. 32. Lescarbot, in <em>Nouv. France</em> (Paris,
1612), p. 469, says of the soil: "It is very good, and delightfully
prolific."</p>

<p>The identity of St. Croix Island was determined in 1798, by the
commissioners appointed, under the treaty of 1783, to determine the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
boundary-line between New Brunswick and the territory of the
United States. Holmes says, in <em>Annals of America</em> (Cambridge,
Mass., 1829), vol. i., p. 122, <em>note</em> 1: "Professor (afterwards President)
Webber, who accompanied the commissioners in 1798, informed
me that they found an island in this river, corresponding to
the French descriptions of the Island St. Croix, and, near the upper
end of it, the remains of a very ancient fortification, overgrown with
large trees; that the foundation stones were traced to a considerable
extent; and that bricks (a specimen of which he showed me)
were found there. These remains were, undoubtedly, the reliques
of De Monts's fortification." Several cannon balls were also discovered
while making excavations on this island, about 1853. The
island has been known as Dochet's Island and Neutral Island;
but in recent years it has been formally and appropriately named
De Monts' Island. See Godfrey's <em>Centennial Discourse</em> (Bangor,
1870), cited in <em>Champlain's Voyages</em> (Prince Soc.), vol. ii., p. 33;
also Williamson's <em>Maine</em>, vol. i., p. 88, and vol. ii., p. 578.</p>

(p. <a href="#Page_47">47</a>).&mdash;George Weymouth, a Bristol navigator, entered Kennebec
River in June, 1605. The stream was called by the natives
Sagadahoc (sometimes spelled Sagadahock). Weymouth's
enthusiastic reports led the Plymouth Company&mdash;of which Lord
John Popham and Sir Ferdinando Gorges were leading members&mdash;to
plant a colony in August, 1607, at first probably on Stage
Island, but later on the shores of Atkins' Bay, ten miles up the
Kennebec. Owing to the death of Popham, their chief patron, and
other misfortunes, the colonists returned to England in 1608. For
several years thereafter, Gorges and Sir Francis Popham&mdash;son
of Lord John&mdash;fitted out trading and fishing expeditions to the region,
but no permanent colony was again attempted on the Kennebec
until 1630. Weymouth had serious difficulties with the natives
(1605), and kidnapped several of them; the colonists themselves
were, towards the close of their stay, cruel to their neighbors;
the outrages in 1609 were doubtless the operations of visiting English
traders. The boats and other English property seen by the
French in 1611, at the Penobscot and Kennebec, of course belonged
to traders, who were at this time numerous along the
main shore. Cf. Williamson's <em>Maine</em>, vol. i., pp. 53, 191-239; and
<em>Memorial Volume of Popham Celebration</em>, Aug. 29, 1862. (Portland,
1863).</p>

by the English), one of the three tribes of the Etchemins,&mdash;the
other two being the Openangos (the Quoddy Indians of English
chronicles) of New Brunswick, and the Marachites of Nova Scotia.
For origin of their name, see <em>Maine Hist. Colls.</em>, vol. vii., p. 100.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
The principal Tarratine village was, a half century later, near where
Bangor now stands. The town visited by Biard was apparently at
or near the present Castine, on Major-bigyduce Point (for derivation
of this name see <em>Maine Hist. Colls.</em>, vol. vi., pp. 107-109).
See topographical description in Williamson's <em>Maine</em>, i., pp. 70, 71.
The "Chiboctous" River, of Biard, was, apparently, but the
"wide-spread" of the Penobscot, stretching eastward of Castine.
French traders were at Castine at a very early date. The English
built a trading fort there in 1625-26, which fell into the hands of the
French in 1632. It was styled Pentagoët in those days; but in 1667,
was rechristened Castine, after Baron de St. Castine, who for several
years maintained a station there. The Dutch were in possession
for a time,&mdash;indeed, Castine was continuously fortified by English,
French, and Dutch, in turn, from about 1610 to 1783.</p>

(p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>). It is possible that the Biscayans originally named
what is still known as Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, after the city
of that name in Spain. It was known to the English by that name
in Biard's time;&mdash;see John Guy's letter, May 16, 1611, in Prowse's
<em>History of Newfoundland</em> (London, 1895), p. 127. Biard merely
gallicizes the word. Placentia is the chief seat of French settlement
in Southern Newfoundland.&mdash;See Howley's <em>Ecclesiastical

(p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>).&mdash;Reference is here made to the Eskimos of Labrador.
Says Prowse, (<em>Hist. N. F.</em>, pp. 590, 591); "The name Esquimaux is
a French corruption of the Abenaki word 'Eskimatsie,' an eater of
raw flesh. The native word is 'Innuit,' meaning 'the people.'
Eskimo is the Danish form of the name, and has now quite supplanted
the old French name." They were probably dubbed
"Excommunicated" in Biard's time, because of the marked hostility
to them of all the other savage tribes in Canada; and the French
early joined the latter in opposing them.&mdash;See Prowse, <em>ut supra</em>, p.
591. The missionaries found the Eskimos difficult material on
which to work; although an occasional captive slave, brought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the St. Lawrence by the Indians, would yield to priestly ministrations.&mdash;See

(p. <a href="#Page_141">141</a>).&mdash;Sable Island is thus described by Champlain, <em>Voyages</em>,
(Prince Soc.), ii., p. 8: "This island is thirty leagues distant north
and south from Cape Breton, and in length is about fifteen leagues.
It contains a small lake. The island is very sandy, and there are no
trees at all of considerable size, only copse and herbage, which serve
as pasturage for the bullocks and cows which the Portuguese carried
there more than sixty years ago."</p>

<p>The origin of the cattle here mentioned is thus explained by Edward
Haies, in his report on Sir Humphrey Gilbert's voyage of 1583,
in Goldsmid's <em>Hakluyt</em>, vol. xii., p. 345: "Sablon lieth to the seaward
of Cape Briton about 25 leagues, whither we were determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
to goe vpon intelligence we had of a Portugal&mdash;who was himselfe
present when the Portugals (abotte thirty yeeres past) did put in the
same Island both Neat and Swine to breede, which were since exceedingly
multiplied." Lescarbot, however, says the cattle were
landed there about 1528, by Baron de Léry; see his <em>Nouv. France</em>,
p. 22. Sable Island is noted as the scene of La Roche's unfortunate
attempt at colonization in 1598, for a graphic description of
which see Parkman's <em>Pioneers</em>, pp. 231-235. See Dionne's note on
"Les Sablons," in his <em>Nouvelle France</em> (Quebec, 1891), pp. 311-316.</p>

given to the region afterwards known as Canada. Peter Martyr
says: "Sebastian Cabot him selfe, named those lands <em>Baccallaos</em>
bycause that in the seas thereabout he founde so great multitudes of
certeyne bigge fysshes much like vnto tunies (which th[e] inhabitantes
caule Baccallaos) that they sumtymes stayed his shippes."&mdash;See
Eden's <em>Three English Books on America</em> (Arber ed., Birmingham,

cited in Browne's <em>History of Cape Breton</em> (London, 1869), p. 13, says:
"It cannot be doubted this name was given by the Basques, who
alone in Europe call that fish Bacalaos, or Bacaleos; the aborigines
term them Apagé." See also Lescarbot's <em>Nouv. France</em>, p. 237;
and Dionne's <em>Nouv. France</em>, pp. 327-331. Cf. Prowse (<em>Hist. N. F.</em>,
p. 589); he says, in claiming the discovery of Newfoundland for the
English, that <em>Baccalao</em> was but "an ordinary trade word, in use
at that period." For an interesting sketch of the Basque fisheries in
Newfoundland, up to the end of the 17th century, see Prowse, <em>ut
supra</em>, pp. 47-49.</p>

<p>That part of the mainland appears on Ribero's map (1529) as "Tiera

(1578), and in map of "Nova Francia et Canada, 1597," in
Wytfleit's <em>Descriptionis Ptolemaicæ Augmentum</em>. The name was
restricted to the southern part of the island of Newfoundland, by
Ramusio (1556); to the island of Cape Breton, by Lescarbot (1612);
to an island east of Newfoundland by De Laet (1640). The name
Baccalos "still clings to an islet about forty miles north of the capital

nephew of and next in succession to Henry IV.; a leader in the
Catholic League, and father of the great Condé. He married, in
1609, Charlotte de Montmorency, then fifteen years old, one of the
most beautiful women of her day. The king fell in love with her,
and his attempted intrigue led to complications that almost caused
a war between France and Spain. Condé rebelled against Louis
XIII., and in September, 1616, was captured and imprisoned; but he
soon afterwards regained his power, which he retained until the ascendancy
of Richelieu displaced it, in 1623; he died in 1646.</p>

<p>The house of Conti was a younger branch of the house of Condé;
that of Soissons was also nearly related to the reigning family of
Bourbon. Charles de Bourbon, count of Soissons, was born in 1556.
He acted for a time with the League, but left it, in the hope of securing
as his wife Catherine of Navarre, and became a military
officer under both Henry III. and Henry IV.; Sully, however, compelled
him to give up his proposed marriage with Catherine. He
was Grand Master of France, under Henry IV.; later, was governor
of Dauphiny, and, at his death, of Normandy. At Champlain's solicitation,
he consented to become the head of De Monts's scheme
for the colonization of Canada; and he was appointed (October 8,
1612) by the king lieutenant general and governor of New France,
Champlain becoming commandant under him. But Soissons died,
on November 1 following; and he was succeeded by Henry, prince
of Condé, with the title of viceroy of New France. Mareschal de
Thémins was appointed by Marie de Médicis, acting viceroy during
Condé's imprisonment. Upon his liberation (1619), Condé sold his
position as viceroy of Canada to Henry, duke of Montmorency, who
in turn sold it (January, 1625) to his nephew, Henry de Lévis, duke
of Ventadour.&mdash;See Rochemonteix's <em>Jésuites</em>, vol. i., pp. 126, 127,
134, 144, 149.</p>

the Ottawa River, Lac de Soissons, in honor of his viceroy; it is

the king's court, made necessary by the increase of its functions,
consequent upon the progress of the royal power in France. Judicial
affairs were allotted to the decision of Parliament; its organization
was defined in 1302, by Philip the Fair, who ordained that it
should assemble at Paris twice a year, for two months, exercising
jurisdiction over the whole kingdom. Charles V. (1364-80) made the
Parliament permanent. Its jurisdiction was much restricted, successively
by Charles VII., Louis XI., and Francis I.; eight other
provincial Parliaments had been formed, by the early part of the
16th century, which reduced that of Paris to little more than a municipal
jurisdiction, and all had been thoroughly subjected to royal
authority. The Parliament of Paris refused, from 1554 to 1662, to admit
the Jesuits into the kingdom, and, later, opposed Henry IV.; but
it was compelled to submit by Mazarin, and, later, by Louis XIV. and
Louis XV. In 1762, however, it decreed the abolition of the order of
Jesuits, and Louis XV. was obliged to confirm this action; though
he exiled the Parliament, eight years later. Within four years, it
was recalled by Louis XVI.; but supporting, in 1789, the privileged
orders against the people, it lost all popularity, and in the following
year was suppressed by the Constituent Assembly. It had been
mainly composed of lawyers ever since Louis XII. forbade any to
enter the Parliament, or to sit as judges, who were not "literate
and graduate."</p>

<em>Smithsonian Report</em> (Washington, 1891), pp. 507-533. His general
conclusion is that corn was "cultivated in greater or less quantities
by all the tribes living east of the Mississippi and south of the great
lakes and the St. Lawrence,"&mdash;indeed, far more extensively than is
generally supposed; and that "the Indian looked upon it as a staple
article of food, both winter and summer; that he cultivated it in
large fields, and understood and appreciated the benefits arising
from the use of fertilizers." Beans, squashes, and pumpkins were
also staple crops. In regard to the labor of women, Carr says:
"The Iroquois or Six Nations are the only people among whom, so
far as I know, it cannot be shown that the warriors did take
some part either in clearing the ground or in cultivating the crop;
and we find that even among them the work was not left exclusively
to the women, but that it was shared by the children and the old
men, as well as the slaves, of whom they seem to have had a goodly
number. *** This statement ['that the field-work was <em>not</em> left entirely
to the women'], as to the actual condition of a large majority of the
tribes living east of the Mississippi and south of the St. Lawrence,
is believed to be true; yet it is not denied that there were many
instances in which this labor was, practically, left to the women,
owing to the fact that the men were away from home, hunting or
fighting. This fact was, unfortunately, of frequent recurrence; but,
as it was the result of an accidental and not of a permanent condition
of affairs, it would hardly be fair to ascribe it to the existence
of any custom, or to any belief in the derogatory character of the
work."&mdash;Cf. Rochemonteix (<em>Jésuites</em>, vol. i., p. 97, <em>note</em>).</p>

of Jerusalem artichoke, <em>Helianthus tuberosus</em>. This plant, indigenous
in the Northern regions of America, had been carried to
Europe by the Italians, who named it <em>girasole</em> (their word for the
sunflower, another species of <em>Helianthus</em>), afterwards corrupted to
<em>Jerusalem</em>. Champlain saw these plants cultivated by the Indians&mdash;in
1605, near Cape Cod; and again at Gloucester, in 1606.&mdash;See
<em>Champlain's Voyages</em> (Prince Soc.), vol. ii., pp. 82, 112. The savages

Lescarbot, in our text, and in his chart of Port Royal, identifies it with
the larger river now called Annapolis. He says it was "named
l'Equille, because the first fish taken therein was an équille." Its
length is about 70 miles, 30 of which are navigable. Littré defines
<em>équille</em> as "the name, on the coasts between Caen and Havre, of the
fish called <em>lançon</em> at Granville and St. Malo, a kind of malacopterygian
fish, living on sandy shores, and hiding in the sand at low tide."</p>

The Capuchins (so named from the sharply-pointed <em>capuce</em>, or hood,
of their robe) were organized in 1528, as a new division of the
<em>Fratres Minores</em> of St. Francis of Assisi; and were received into
France in 1573, at the request of Charles IX., and at the recommendation
of Cardinal Lorraine. In 1632, they, were asked by Richelieu
to take charge of the religious affairs of Canada; but, they declined
this proposal, ostensibly through unwillingness to displace the
Jesuits, and later went to Acadia. For an account of their work in
Maine, see <em>Historical Magazine</em>, vol. viii., p. 301.</p>

<p>The Cordeliers, named from the knotted cord worn at the waist,
have two branches,&mdash;the conventuals, who are allowed to possess
real estate; and the observants, who may not own any property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>

The Récollets, strictest of all the Franciscan orders, were thus
termed because, devoting themselves to religious meditation (Fr.
<em>récollection</em>), they asked from Pope Clement VII., in 1531, permission
to retire into special convents, that they might more literally
observe their founder's rule. For an account of their missionary
work in Canada, see Editor's Introduction, vol. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44669/44669-h/44669-h.htm">i</a>. of this series.
They carried on extensive missionary labors in Spanish America,
where, in 1621, they had 500 convents, distributed in 22 provinces.&mdash;Ferland's
<em>Cours d'Histoire</em>, vol. i., p. 169.</p>

<p>The Minimes were founded in 1453, by St. Francis de Paula, of
Calabria. Their rule is especially austere, involving total abstinence
from wine, flesh, and fish, and even from eggs, milk, or butter.
Their founder named them <em>Minimos Fratres</em>, as a special indication
of humility. He also instituted an order of Minimes for
women, in 1493.</p>

1567 and 1570 (the exact date is unknown); his parents lived at
Brouage, a fortified town in Saintonge, where was a large manufacture
of salt and the finest harbor on the French coast. Champlain
became a navigator early in life, and was also a quartermaster in
the royal army in Brittany, from 1592 to 1598.</p>

<p>His first voyage to America was in the service of the King of
Spain; he spent the time from January, 1599, to March, 1601, in the
West Indies and Mexico, and on the northern coast of South
America. His valuable MS. report of this voyage, illustrated by his
own sketches, was first printed in 1859 (but in an English translation),
by the Hakluyt Society, at London; in it he suggests a ship
canal across the isthmus of Panama. In 1603, he sailed, with Pontgravé
to Canada, exploring the St. Lawrence as far as the Falls of
St. Louis; and again, with De Monts, early in 1604, when they
founded the St. Croix colony. Champlain remained in Canada
three years, carefully exploring the Atlantic coast from Canso to
Wood's Holl, and returned to France in October, 1607. The next
summer, he explored the valley of the St. Lawrence, with the Saguenay
and other tributaries, and founded the settlement of Quebec.
October 15, 1612, he was formally appointed commandant in New
France. Quebec was captured by the English, July 20, 1629; but
was restored to the French by the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye,
March 29, 1632. Champlain, being again appointed governor of New
France, returned to Quebec in May, 1633, where he died December
25, 1635.</p>

Bay of Chaleurs; to have the form of a woman, though of horrible
aspect, and so tall that the masts of a ship would not reach to the
monster's girdle; and to carry off and devour men. Champlain
gives a full account of this belief, and regards <em>Gougou</em> as a demon
who tormented the natives; see Laverdière's <em>Champlain</em>, pp.
125-126. Lescarbot, in his <em>Nouv. France</em>, pp. 397-403, gives the
same description, and tries to prove, in a long discussion, that
<em>Gougou</em> is a sort of personification of a tormenting conscience.</p>

the bay. A fortnight later, an expedition sent to St. Mary's Bay,
to search for silver and iron ore, accidentally encountered poor
Aubry, almost dead with fatigue and hunger, and brought him back
to Port Royal. This rescue was especially gratifying to De Monts,
as the priest's disappearance had caused a Protestant, who had
quarreled with him about religious questions, to be accused of murdering
Aubry.&mdash;<em>Champlain's Voyages</em> (Prince Soc.), vol. ii., pp. 20, 21.</p>

by early explorers and writers; it thus appears on the map of
Jean Allefonsce, given in his <em>Cosmographie</em> (Paris, ed., 1575), fol. 183<sup>A</sup>;
and is so named by Champlain, in his <em>Voyages</em>. The origin of the
name Canada is variously explained; but there are two leading
theories: (1) That the word signifies, in Iroquois, "town," or
"village." See Laverdière's <em>Champlain</em>, p. 89, <em>note</em> 4; Faillon's
<em>Col. Fr.</em> vol. i., p. 14; <em>Hist. Mag.</em> vol. i., pp. 153, 217, 349; and
<em>Mag. Amer. Hist.</em>, vol. x., pp. 161, 162. (2) That it comes from
another and similar Iroquois word, meaning "lake," being applied
to the country as a region abounding in lakes. See <em>Hist. Mag.</em>,
vol. i., pp. 188, 315; cf. Winsor's <em>N. and C. Hist.</em> vol. iv., p. 67,
<em>note</em> 1.&mdash;Cf. Ferland's <em>Cours d'Histoire</em>, vol. i., p. 25. The name
was applied in the earlier maps (e.g., Zaltieri, 1566; Ortelius, 1570;
Judæis, 1593) to a district lying along the St Lawrence, between the
Saguenay and Isle aux Coudres, or thereabouts. Later, it was
given to all, or nearly all, of the valley of the St. Lawrence. See

d'un gran Capitano di Mare Francese," found in Ramusio's <em>Raccolta</em>
(Venice, 1556), vol. iii., p. 423. The "Discorso" is supposed to have
been written in 1539; the name of the author was unknown to
Ramusio himself, but is said by Estancelin, in <em>Recherches * * *
des navigateurs Normands</em> (Paris, 1832), to be Jean Parmentier, of
Dieppe. See Winsor's <em>N. and C. Hist.</em>, vol. iv., pp. 16, 63: cf. also

(p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>).&mdash;Another name for the St. Lawrence River. The
apparent etymology of this name would suggest that it was given on
account of the powerful current of the river, and its discharge into
the Gulf of St. Lawrence. See Trumbull's "Composition of Indian
Geographical Names," in <em>Conn. Histor. Soc. Colls.</em>, vol. ii., p. 30.

(p. <a href="#Page_205">205</a>).&mdash;One of the principal tributaries of the St. Lawrence,
entering the latter 120 miles N. E. of Quebec. It is 100 miles in
length, and remarkable for its wild and picturesque scenery; along
the lower half of its course the banks vary in height from 500 to
1,500 feet, often overhanging the swift current below. Its ordinary
depth varies from 100 to 1,000 feet, and even reaches over 3,000 feet
near its month. It is the outlet of Lake St. John, and was for the
French the chief avenue of approach to the Indian tribes around
that lake, and even (by portages) to those of Hudson Bay region.
This river was, throughout the French régime, the center of both
trading and missionary activities for all Northeastern Canada.
Tadoussac, at its month, from earliest times a favorite rendezvous
of the Montagnais and other Eastern tribes, became under the
French an important fur-trade center and Jesuit mission; and is, to-day,
a notable watering-place.</p>

<p>The name is also spelled Sagnay, Sagné, Saghuny, etc. Thévet,
in his <em>Grande Insulaire</em> (a MS. preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale
of Paris, and written before 1571: see Harrisse's <em>notes sur
la Nouvelle France</em>, p. 278), declares that the savages then called
this river <em>Thadoyseau</em>; while Lalemant (in <em>Relation</em> of 1646) says
that they called Tadoussac <em>Sadilege</em>. Probably these names were
indifferently applied, in that early time, alike to river and village.
Laverdière derives Saguenay from the Montagnais <em>saki-nip</em>, "the
rushing water." See his <em>Champlain</em>, pp. 68, 69; also Trumbull, in
<em>Conn. Hist. Colls.</em>, vol. ii., p. 31.</p>

two islands at its mouth divide it into three channels. On
Creuxius' map (1660), it appears as Metaberoutin River, or Three
Rivers; on Duval's (1679), the Rivière de Foix. This last appellation
seems to be another form of Riuiere du Fouez, given to this
river by Cartier. See <em>Champlain's Voyages</em> (Prince Soc.), vol. i.,

Champlain in 1634.</p>

1535, and was then occupied by an Indian village, named Stadacona.
The foundation of the present city was laid by Champlain, July 3,
1608; for his chart of Quebec and vicinity (with valuable notes
thereon, by the editor), and an engraved illustration of the buildings
erected by him, see Laverdière's <em>Champlain</em>, pp. 296, 303. Quebec
is also written Quebeck, Quebecq (Champlain), and Kebec, Kébec, or
Kebek (<em>Relations</em>); the word, in various Algonkin dialects, signifies
"the narrowing of the water," referring to the contraction of the St.
Lawrence, opposite Cape Diamond, to a space of only 1,314 yards;
while below, at the confluence of the St. Charles, it spreads into a
basin over 2,500 yards in width. See Ferland's <em>Cours d'Histoire</em>,

<em>Brittayne</em>, etc.), was given, at an early date, to the most eastern
point of Cape Breton Island, "first seen by some French sailors,
who named it either after Bretagne, or from Cape Breton, a town
in the election of Landes, in Gascony."&mdash;Bourinot (<em>Canad. Mo.</em>,

Laverdière's <em>Champlain</em>, p. 155; and on same page is a quotation
from Thévet's <em>Gr. Insul.</em> (1556) which mentions "the cape or promontory
of Lorraine, so named by us; others have given it the name
of <em>Cape of the Bretons</em>," etc. The island itself was known, during
the 16th century, as Isle du Cap Breton, or Isle des Bretons; Champlain,
in <em>Voyages</em> (Prince Soc.), vol. i., p. 280, calls it St. Lawrence;
the French named it Isle Royale, upon its cession to them by the
treaty of Utrecht (1713); its old name, Cape Breton Island, was resumed
in 1758, after the capture of Louisbourg by the English. On
Gastaldo's map (1548), the name Breton is applied both to this island
and to Nova Scotia. See Dionne's note on Cape Breton (<em>Nouv.

<p><em>Sesambre</em>, "an island thus named by some Mallouins, distant 15
leagues from La Héve," says Champlain. Laverdière thus explains
the name: "In remembrance of a small island of that name which
lies in front of St. Malo. Sésambre became S. Sambre; and the
English sailors, who are not greatly devoted to the saints, have
called it simply Sambro" (its present name). A cape and harbor
near the island bear the same name. Sesambre appears on De
Laet's map (1633), as Sesambre; on Bellin's (1744), as Sincembre;
but in his <em>Petit Atlas Maritime</em> (1764), also on Chabert's map
(1746), as St. Cendre. In Champlain's <em>Voyages</em> (Prince Soc.),

<p><em>Chat</em>, a corruption of <em>Chaste</em>, the name of Champlain's early patron.
Sieur Aymar de Chaste (Chattes, or Chastes), for many years
the governor of Dieppe, distinguished both as soldier and sailor,
and a personal friend of Henry IV., had formed at Rouen, under a
royal commission, a company to prosecute further explorations in
Canada. In March, 1603, he sent Pontgravé and Champlain thither,
to select a location for the colony he proposed to establish, and to
make other preliminary explorations and arrangements; see Laverdière's
<em>Champlain</em>, pp. 700-704, and 1090, <em>note</em>. During their absence,
De Chaste died (May 13, 1603), and his schemes were soon
taken up by De Monts (vol. i., <em>note</em> <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44669/44669-h/44669-h.htm#endnote_2._2">2</a>).&mdash;See Faillon's <em>Col. Fr.</em>, vol.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>

(whither he was sent in 1583, with a military force by Catherine de
Médicis), forms part of Thévenot's <em>Relations de divers Voyages
Curieux</em> (Paris, 1596), under the heading "Voyage de la Tercere."</p>

by Jacques Cartier, at the mouth of the river called by him St. Croix,
but afterwards named St. Charles, by the Récollet missionaries, in
honor of Charles des Boues, grand vicar of Pontoise.&mdash;See Shea's
ed. of Le Clercq's <em>Establishment of the Faith</em> (N. Y., 1881), p. 149.
Those of De Monts, at St. Croix and Port Royal, have been already
described by Lescarbot. In regard to the settlement at Quebec,
which the text inadvertently mentions as the third, instead of the
fourth, it was on the northern bank of the St. Lawrence, not the
southern, as he says here. The fifth, that of St. Sauveur, is fully
described in the present volume.</p>

35 miles above Quebec. A small island, not far from this point,
was called Ste. Croix Island, up to 1633; after that time, Richelieu,
for the great cardinal. As intimated in the text, there has been a
difference of opinion as to the place where Cartier spent the winter
of 1535-36. Charlevoix (Shea's ed., vol. i., p. 116), claimed that the
point mentioned above (Platon) was the St. Croix of Cartier; but
Champlain and other authorities have shown that it was, instead, at
St. Charles River. See Laverdière's <em>Champlain</em>, pp. 90-93, and

the profusion of wild grapes found there. Thévet (<em>Gr. Insul.</em>) says
it was called by the natives Minigo. Its later name, Isle of Orleans,
would seem to have been given by Cartier, during his first sojourn
at Quebec. See Laverdière's <em>Champlain</em>, p. 88. Le Jeune (<em>Relation</em>

that Canada was first called New France in 1609; and he
brings much evidence, both circumstantial and direct, to show that
this appellation was of much earlier date. He considers it highly

to the college of Eu, as acting superior. Four years later, he went
to Acadia. After returning to France he devoted himself to preaching
in cities and villages. In 1616, he became a "spiritual coadjutor"
in his order&mdash;according to Littré, one who publicly takes the
three religious vows, but not the fourth, which is to go on whatever
mission he may be sent. His death occurred April 18, 1647.&mdash;See

one of Pontrincourt's colony at Port Royal. In 1617, he returned to
Canada with his family, at Champlain's request, as one of the latter's
colonists at Quebec. He was the first settler with a family,
and the first at Quebec to cultivate the soil as a means of livelihood;
and on this account has sometimes been called "the father of
Canada,"&mdash;an appellation also given, and with even more propriety,
to Champlain. His dwelling was the first in Upper Town,
and, according to Ferland (<em>Cours d'Histoire</em>, vol. i., p. 190), was
between the present Ste. Famille and Couillard streets.&mdash;Cf. Laverdière's
<em>Champlain</em>, p. 988. He was in many ways prominent in the
early history of the colony. In 1621, he bore the title of "royal
procurator." In 1622, he was, according to Champlain, in Tadoussac,
acting as commander of De Caen's ship during the latter's
temporary absence. In 1626, the fief of St. Joseph, on the river St.
Charles, was granted by Ventadour to Hébert, under the title of
Sieur d'Espinay. In January, 1627, a fall caused Hébert's death;
he was buried in the cemetery of the Récollets, by whom, as well as
by Champlain, he seems to have been greatly esteemed.&mdash;See
Sagard's <em>Canada</em>, pp. 590, 591. When Quebec was taken by the
English, in 1629, Louis Kirk, at Champlain's solicitation, sent a
guard of soldiers to protect the widow Hébert's house, as well as the
mission chapels. Many distinguished Canadian families trace their
descent from Hébert; as is shown in Tanguay's <em>Dictionnaire Généalogique</em>
(Montreal, 1871-90), vol. i., p. 301.&mdash;Cf. Ferland's <em>Cours
d'Histoire</em>, vol. i., p. 180, <em>note</em>. His daughter Anne married
Stephen Jonquest, in the autumn of 1617&mdash;this was the first marriage
in Canada according to church rites, and was performed by
the Récollet Father Le Caron; she died in 1620. Another daughter,
Guillemette, married William Couillard, August 26, 1621; she died in
October, 1684. An island in the harbor of Port Royal was named
for Hébert, but is now known as Bear Island.</p>

the first quarter of the 17th century, prominent as an English
naval commander. His mother was married a second time, to Laurence Washington,
an ancestor of George Washington. His destruction
of the French settlements has been bitterly censured by some
writers, as the act of a buccaneer and pirate; but he was commissioned
to do this by the Virginia colonial authorities, who afterwards
declared that, in the encounter at St. Sauveur, the first shot
was fired by the French. A letter was written by Montmorency,
admiral of France, to King James of England, October 28, 1613, asking
for the release of the Jesuit fathers, and redress for the injuries
done to the property of Madame de Guercheville. The Virginia
Council, when called to account for Argall's doings, made a spirited
reply in his and their own defense; and the English Privy Council
refused to make any reparation to Madame de Guercheville, alleging
that "her ship entered by force the territory of the said colony [Virginia]
to settle there, and to trade without their permission."

(p. <a href="#Page_259">259</a>).&mdash;This pilot is called Le Bailleur, of Rouen, in Biard's
<em>Relation</em> of 1616. Charlevoix (Shea's ed., vol. i., pp. 280-281) erroneously
confounds him with one Lamets, named by Champlain as
among the five who escaped from the ship, but after the pilot had
left it on his reconnoitring trip. These men seem to have later
joined the pilot, as he had 14 men when he encountered La Saussaye.</p>

on Bellin's (1744) and D'Anville's (1746), as Paspebiac; named
Sheet Harbor on Gesner's (1849).</p>

being an appellation of the wild ram (<em>Ovis aries</em>), found in
the mountains of Greece, in Corsica, and in the steppes of Tartary.</p>

aided Sieur de la Motte to regain his liberty, as Biard narrates in his
<em>Relation</em> of 1616. In 1617, he was addressed by Raleigh as "member
of the Council of State of France."</p>

Britain; generally identified with Wissant, a village in Pas-du-Calais,
ten miles S. W. of Calais. Biard says, however, in the <em>Relation</em>
of 1616, that it was Calais where they landed.</p>
